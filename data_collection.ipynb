Space exploration is the use of astronomy and space technology to explore outer space 1 While the exploration of space is currently carried out mainly by astronomers with telescopes its physical exploration is conducted both by uncrewed robotic space probes and human spaceflight Space exploration like its classical form astronomy is one of the main sources for space science While the observation of objects in space known as astronomy predates reliable recorded history it was the development of large and relatively efficient rockets during the midtwentieth century that allowed physical space exploration to become a reality Common rationales for exploring space include advancing scientific research national prestige uniting different nations ensuring the future survival of humanity and developing military and strategic advantages against other countries 2 The early era of space exploration was driven by a Space Race between the Soviet Union and the United States A driving force of the start of space exploration was during the Cold War After the ability to create nuclear weapons the narrative of defenseoffense left land and the power to control the air the focus Both the Soviet Union and the US were racing to prove their superiority in technology through exploring space In fact the reason NASA was created was as a response to Sputnik I 3 The launch of the first humanmade object to orbit Earth the Soviet Unions Sputnik 1 on 4 October 1957 and the first Moon landing by the American Apollo 11 mission on 20 July 1969 are often taken as landmarks for this initial period The Soviet space program achieved many of the first milestones including the first living being in orbit in 1957 the first human spaceflight in 1961 the first spacewalk on 18 March 1965 the first automatic landing on another celestial body in 1966 and the launch of the first space station in 1971 After the first 20 years of exploration focus shifted from oneoff flights to renewable hardware such as the Space Shuttle program and from competition to cooperation as with the International Space Station With the substantial completion of the ISS 4 following STS133 in March 2011 plans for space exploration by the US remained in flux The Constellation program aiming for a return to the Moon by 2020 5 was judged unrealistic by an expert review panel reporting in 2009 6 Constellation ultimately was replaced with the Artemis Program of which the first mission occurred in 2022 with a planned crewed landing to occur with Artemis III 7 The rise of the private space industry also began in earnest in the 2010s with the development of private launch vehicles space capsules and satellite manufacturing In the 2000s China initiated a successful crewed spaceflight program while India launched the Chandrayaan programme while the European Union and Japan have also planned future crewed space missions The two primary global programs gaining traction in the 2020s are the Chineseled International Lunar Research Station and the USled Artemis Program with its plan to build the Lunar Gateway and the Artemis Base Camp each having its own set of international partners History of exploration edit See also History of astronomy Discovery and exploration of the Solar System Timeline of space exploration Timeline of first orbital launches by country and Outer space Discovery V2 Rocket in the Peenemnde Museum First telescopes edit The first telescope is said to have been invented in 1608 in the Netherlands by an eyeglass maker named Hans Lippershey but their first recorded use in astronomy was by Galileo Galilei in 1609 8 In 1668 Isaac Newton built his own reflecting telescope the first fully functional telescope of this kind and a landmark for future developments due to its superior features over the previous Galilean telescope 9 A string of discoveries in the Solar System followed then and in the next centuries the mountains of the Moon the phases of Venus the main satellites of Jupiter and Saturn the rings of Saturn many comets the asteroids the new planets Uranus and Neptune and many more satellites The Orbiting Astronomical Observatory 2 was the first space telescope launched 1968 10 but the launching of Hubble Space Telescope in 1990 11 set a milestone As of 1 December 2022 there were 5284 confirmed exoplanets discovered The Milky Way is estimated to contain 100400 billion stars 12 and more than 100 billion planets 13 There are at least 2 trillion galaxies in the observable universe 14 15 HD1 is the most distant known object from Earth reported as 334 billion lightyears away 16 17 18 19 20 21 First outer space flights edit Model of Vostok spacecraft Apollo Command Service Module in lunar orbit MW 18014 was a German V2 rocket test launch that took place on 20 June 1944 at the Peenemnde Army Research Center in Peenemnde It was the first humanmade object to reach outer space attaining an apogee of 176 kilometers 22 which is well above the Krmn line 23 It was a vertical test launch Although the rocket reached space it did not reach orbital velocity and therefore returned to Earth in an impact becoming the first suborbital spaceflight 24 In 1949 the BumperWAC reached an altitude of 393 kilometres becoming the first humanmade object to enter space according to NASA 25 First object in orbit edit The first successful orbital launch was of the Soviet uncrewed Sputnik 1 mission on 4 October 1957 The satellite weighed about 83 kg and is believed to have orbited Earth at a height of about 250 km It had two radio transmitters which emitted beeps that could be heard by radios around the globe Analysis of the radio signals was used to gather information about the electron density of the ionosphere while temperature and pressure data was encoded in the duration of radio beeps The results indicated that the satellite was not punctured by a meteoroid Sputnik 1 was launched by an R7 rocket It burned up upon reentry on 3 January 1958 First human outer space flight edit The first successful human spaceflight was Vostok 1 carrying the 27yearold Russian cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin on 12 April 1961 The spacecraft completed one orbit around the globe lasting about 1 hour and 48 minutes Gagarins flight resonated around the world it was a demonstration of the advanced Soviet space program and it opened an entirely new era in space exploration human spaceflight First astronomical body space explorations edit The first artificial object to reach another celestial body was Luna 2 reaching the Moon in 1959 26 The first soft landing on another celestial body was performed by Luna 9 landing on the Moon on 3 February 1966 27 Luna 10 became the first artificial satellite of the Moon entering in a lunar orbit on 3 April 1966 28 The first crewed landing on another celestial body was performed by Apollo 11 on 20 July 1969 landing on the Moon There have been a total of six spacecraft with humans landing on the Moon starting from 1969 to the last human landing in 1972 The first interplanetary flyby was the 1961 Venera 1 flyby of Venus though the 1962 Mariner 2 was the first flyby of Venus to return data Pioneer 6 was the first satellite to orbit the Sun launched on 16 December 1965 The other planets were first flown by in 1965 for Mars by Mariner 4 1973 for Jupiter by Pioneer 10 1974 for Mercury by Mariner 10 1979 for Saturn by Pioneer 11 1986 for Uranus by Voyager 2 1989 for Neptune by Voyager 2 In 2015 the dwarf planets Ceres and Pluto were orbited by Dawn and passed by New Horizons respectively This accounts for flybys of each of the eight planets in the Solar System the Sun the Moon and Ceres and Pluto The first interplanetary surface mission to return at least limited surface data from another planet was the 1970 landing of Venera 7 which returned data to Earth for 23 minutes from Venus In 1975 Venera 9 was the first to return images from the surface of another planet returning images from Venus In 1971 the Mars 3 mission achieved the first soft landing on Mars returning data for almost 20 seconds Later much longer duration surface missions were achieved including over six years of Mars surface operation by Viking 1 from 1975 to 1982 and over two hours of transmission from the surface of Venus by Venera 13 in 1982 the longest ever Soviet planetary surface mission Venus and Mars are the two planets outside of Earth on which humans have conducted surface missions with uncrewed robotic spacecraft First space station edit Salyut 1 was the first space station of any kind launched into low Earth orbit by the Soviet Union on 19 April 1971 The International Space Station is currently the largest and oldest of the 2 current fully functional space stations inhabited continuously since the year 2000 The other Tiangong space station built by China is now fully crewed and operational First interstellar space flight edit Voyager 1 became the first humanmade object to leave the Solar System into interstellar space on 25 August 2012 The probe passed the heliopause at 121 AU to enter interstellar space 29 Farthest from Earth edit The Apollo 13 flight passed the far side of the Moon at an altitude of 254 kilometers above the lunar surface and 400171 km from Earth marking the record for the farthest humans have ever traveled from Earth in 1970 As of 26 November 2022 update Voyager 1 was at a distance of 159 AU from Earth 30 It is the most distant humanmade object from Earth 31 Targets of exploration edit Starting in the mid20th century probes and then human missions were sent into Earth orbit and then on to the Moon Also probes were sent throughout the known Solar System and into Solar orbit Uncrewed spacecraft have been sent into orbit around Saturn Jupiter Mars Venus and Mercury by the 21st century and the most distance active spacecraft Voyager 1 and 2 traveled beyond 100 times the EarthSun distance The instruments were enough though that it is thought they have left the Suns heliosphere a sort of bubble of particles made in the Galaxy by the Suns solar wind The Sun edit The Sun is a major focus of space exploration Being above the atmosphere in particular and Earths magnetic field gives access to the solar wind and infrared and ultraviolet radiations that cannot reach Earths surface The Sun generates most space weather which can affect power generation and transmission systems on Earth and interfere with and even damage satellites and space probes Numerous spacecraft dedicated to observing the Sun beginning with the Apollo Telescope Mount have been launched and still others have had solar observation as a secondary objective Parker Solar Probe launched in 2018 will approach the Sun to within 19th the orbit of Mercury Mercury edit Main article Exploration of Mercury A MESSENGER image from 18000 km showing a region about 500 km across Mercury remains the least explored of the Terrestrial planets As of May 2013 the Mariner 10 and MESSENGER missions have been the only missions that have made close observations of Mercury MESSENGER entered orbit around Mercury in March 2011 to further investigate the observations made by Mariner 10 in 1975 A third mission to Mercury scheduled to arrive in 2025 BepiColombo is to include two probes BepiColombo is a joint mission between Japan and the European Space Agency MESSENGER and BepiColombo are intended to gather complementary data to help scientists understand many of the mysteries discovered by Mariner 10s flybys Flights to other planets within the Solar System are accomplished at a cost in energy which is described by the net change in velocity of the spacecraft or deltav Due to the relatively high deltav to reach Mercury and its proximity to the Sun it is difficult to explore and orbits around it are rather unstable Venus edit Main article Observations and explorations of Venus Venus was the first target of interplanetary flyby and lander missions and despite one of the most hostile surface environments in the Solar System has had more landers sent to it than any other planet in the Solar System The first flyby was the 1961 Venera 1 though the 1962 Mariner 2 was the first flyby to successfully return data Mariner 2 has been followed by several other flybys by multiple space agencies often as part of missions using a Venus flyby to provide a gravitational assist en route to other celestial bodies In 1967 Venera 4 became the first probe to enter and directly examine the atmosphere of Venus In 1970 Venera 7 became the first successful lander to reach the surface of Venus and by 1985 it had been followed by eight additional successful Soviet Venus landers which provided images and other direct surface data Starting in 1975 with the Soviet orbiter Venera 9 some ten successful orbiter missions have been sent to Venus including later missions which were able to map the surface of Venus using radar to pierce the obscuring atmosphere Earth edit Main article Earth observation satellite First television image of Earth from space taken by TIROS1 Space exploration has been used as a tool to understand Earth as a celestial object Orbital missions can provide data for Earth that can be difficult or impossible to obtain from a purely groundbased point of reference For example the existence of the Van Allen radiation belts was unknown until their discovery by the United States first artificial satellite Explorer 1 These belts contain radiation trapped by Earths magnetic fields which currently renders construction of habitable space stations above 1000 km impractical Following this early unexpected discovery a large number of Earth observation satellites have been deployed specifically to explore Earth from a spacebased perspective These satellites have significantly contributed to the understanding of a variety of Earthbased phenomena For instance the hole in the ozone layer was found by an artificial satellite that was exploring Earths atmosphere and satellites have allowed for the discovery of archeological sites or geological formations that were difficult or impossible to otherwise identify Moon edit Main article Exploration of the Moon Apollo 16 LEM Orion the Lunar Roving Vehicle and astronaut John Young The Moon was the first celestial body to be the object of space exploration It holds the distinctions of being the first remote celestial object to be flown by orbited and landed upon by spacecraft and the only remote celestial object ever to be visited by humans In 1959 the Soviets obtained the first images of the far side of the Moon never previously visible to humans The US exploration of the Moon began with the Ranger 4 impactor in 1962 Starting in 1966 the Soviets successfully deployed a number of landers to the Moon which were able to obtain data directly from the Moons surface just four months later Surveyor 1 marked the debut of a successful series of US landers The Soviet uncrewed missions culminated in the Lunokhod program in the early 1970s which included the first uncrewed rovers and also successfully brought lunar soil samples to Earth for study This marked the first automated return of extraterrestrial soil samples to Earth Uncrewed exploration of the Moon continues with various nations periodically deploying lunar orbiters Chinas Change 4 in 2019 and Change 6 in 2024 achieved the worlds first landing and sample return on the far side of the Moon Indias Chandrayaan3 in 2023 achieved the worlds first landing on the lunar south pole region Crewed exploration of the Moon began in 1968 with the Apollo 8 mission that successfully orbited the Moon the first time any extraterrestrial object was orbited by humans In 1969 the Apollo 11 mission marked the first time humans set foot upon another world Crewed exploration of the Moon did not continue for long The Apollo 17 mission in 1972 marked the sixth landing and the most recent human visit Artemis II is scheduled to complete a crewed flyby of the Moon in 2025 and Artemis III will perform the first lunar landing since Apollo 17 with it scheduled for launch no earlier than 2026 Robotic missions are still pursued vigorously Mars edit Main article Exploration of Mars Surface of Mars by the Spirit rover The exploration of Mars has been an important part of the space exploration programs of the Soviet Union the United States Europe Japan and India Dozens of robotic spacecraft including orbiters landers and rovers have been launched toward Mars since the 1960s These missions were aimed at gathering data about current conditions and answering questions about the history of Mars The questions raised by the scientific community are expected to not only give a better appreciation of the Red Planet but also yield further insight into the past and possible future of Earth The exploration of Mars has come at a considerable financial cost with roughly twothirds of all spacecraft destined for Mars failing before completing their missions with some failing before they even began Such a high failure rate can be attributed to the complexity and large number of variables involved in an interplanetary journey and has led researchers to jokingly speak of The Great Galactic Ghoul 32 which subsists on a diet of Mars probes This phenomenon is also informally known as the Mars Curse 33 In contrast to overall high failure rates in the exploration of Mars India has become the first country to achieve success of its maiden attempt Indias Mars Orbiter Mission 34 35 36 is one of the least expensive interplanetary missions ever undertaken with an approximate total cost of 450 Crore 37 38 The first mission to Mars by any Arab country has been taken up by the United Arab Emirates Called the Emirates Mars Mission it was launched on 19 July 2020 and went into orbit around Mars on 9 February 2021 The uncrewed exploratory probe was named Hope Probe and was sent to Mars to study its atmosphere in detail 39 Phobos edit Main article Exploration of Phobos The Russian space mission FobosGrunt which launched on 9 November 2011 experienced a failure leaving it stranded in low Earth orbit 40 It was to begin exploration of the Phobos and Martian circumterrestrial orbit and study whether the moons of Mars or at least Phobos could be a transshipment point for spaceships traveling to Mars 41 Asteroids edit Main article Exploration of the asteroids Asteroid 4 Vesta imaged by the Dawn spacecraft Until the advent of space travel objects in the asteroid belt were merely pinpricks of light in even the largest telescopes their shapes and terrain remaining a mystery Several asteroids have now been visited by probes the first of which was Galileo which flew past two 951 Gaspra in 1991 followed by 243 Ida in 1993 Both of these lay near enough to Galileo s planned trajectory to Jupiter that they could be visited at acceptable cost The first landing on an asteroid was performed by the NEAR Shoemaker probe in 2000 following an orbital survey of the object 433 Eros The dwarf planet Ceres and the asteroid 4 Vesta two of the three largest asteroids were visited by NASAs Dawn spacecraft launched in 2007 Hayabusa was a robotic spacecraft developed by the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency to return a sample of material from the small nearEarth asteroid 25143 Itokawa to Earth for further analysis Hayabusa was launched on 9 May 2003 and rendezvoused with Itokawa in midSeptember 2005 After arriving at Itokawa Hayabusa studied the asteroids shape spin topography color composition density and history In November 2005 it landed on the asteroid twice to collect samples The spacecraft returned to Earth on 13 June 2010 Jupiter edit Main article Exploration of Jupiter Tupan Patera on Jupiters moon Io The exploration of Jupiter has consisted solely of a number of automated NASA spacecraft visiting the planet since 1973 A large majority of the missions have been flybys in which detailed observations are taken without the probe landing or entering orbit such as in Pioneer and Voyager programs The Galileo and Juno spacecraft are the only spacecraft to have entered the planets orbit As Jupiter is believed to have only a relatively small rocky core and no real solid surface a landing mission is precluded Reaching Jupiter from Earth requires a deltav of 92 kms 42 which is comparable to the 97 kms deltav needed to reach low Earth orbit 43 Fortunately gravity assists through planetary flybys can be used to reduce the energy required at launch to reach Jupiter albeit at the cost of a significantly longer flight duration 42 Jupiter has 95 known moons many of which have relatively little known information about them Saturn edit Main article Exploration of Saturn Saturn has been explored only through uncrewed spacecraft launched by NASA including one mission planned and executed in cooperation with other space agencies These missions consist of flybys in 1979 by Pioneer 11 in 1980 by Voyager 1 in 1982 by Voyager 2 and an orbital mission by the Cassini spacecraft which lasted from 2004 until 2017 Saturn has at least 62 known moons although the exact number is debatable since Saturns rings are made up of vast numbers of independently orbiting objects of varying sizes The largest of the moons is Titan which holds the distinction of being the only moon in the Solar System with an atmosphere denser and thicker than that of Earth Titan holds the distinction of being the only object in the Outer Solar System that has been explored with a lander the Huygens probe deployed by the Cassini spacecraft Uranus edit Main article Exploration of Uranus The exploration of Uranus has been entirely through the Voyager 2 spacecraft with no other visits currently planned Given its axial tilt of 9777 with its polar regions exposed to sunlight or darkness for long periods scientists were not sure what to expect at Uranus The closest approach to Uranus occurred on 24 January 1986 Voyager 2 studied the planets unique atmosphere and magnetosphere Voyager 2 also examined its ring system and the moons of Uranus including all five of the previously known moons while discovering an additional ten previously unknown moons Images of Uranus proved to have a uniform appearance with no evidence of the dramatic storms or atmospheric banding evident on Jupiter and Saturn Great effort was required to even identify a few clouds in the images of the planet The magnetosphere of Uranus however proved to be unique being profoundly affected by the planets unusual axial tilt In contrast to the bland appearance of Uranus itself striking images were obtained of the Moons of Uranus including evidence that Miranda had been unusually geologically active Neptune edit Main article Exploration of Neptune The exploration of Neptune began with the 25 August 1989 Voyager 2 flyby the sole visit to the system as of 2025 The possibility of a Neptune Orbiter has been discussed but no other missions have been given serious thought Although the extremely uniform appearance of Uranus during Voyager 2 s visit in 1986 had led to expectations that Neptune would also have few visible atmospheric phenomena the spacecraft found that Neptune had obvious banding visible clouds auroras and even a conspicuous anticyclone storm system rivaled in size only by Jupiters Great Red Spot Neptune also proved to have the fastest winds of any planet in the Solar System measured as high as 2100 kmh 44 Voyager 2 also examined Neptunes ring and moon system It discovered 900 complete rings and additional partial ring arcs around Neptune In addition to examining Neptunes three previously known moons Voyager 2 also discovered five previously unknown moons one of which Proteus proved to be the last largest moon in the system Data from Voyager 2 supported the view that Neptunes largest moon Triton is a captured Kuiper belt object 45 Pluto edit Main article Pluto Exploration The dwarf planet Pluto presents significant challenges for spacecraft because of its great distance from Earth and small mass Voyager 1 could have visited Pluto but controllers opted instead for a close flyby of Saturns moon Titan resulting in a trajectory incompatible with a Pluto flyby Voyager 2 never had a plausible trajectory for reaching Pluto 46 After an intense political battle a mission to Pluto dubbed New Horizons was granted funding from the United States government in 2003 47 New Horizons was launched successfully on 19 January 2006 In early 2007 the craft made use of a gravity assist from Jupiter Its closest approach to Pluto was on 14 July 2015 scientific observations of Pluto began five months prior to closest approach and continued for 16 days after the encounter Kuiper Belt Objects edit The New Horizons mission also performed a flyby of the small planetesimal Arrokoth in the Kuiper belt in 2019 This was its first extended mission 48 Comets edit Main article List of missions to comets Comet 103PHartley Although many comets have been studied from Earth sometimes with centuriesworth of observations only a few comets have been closely visited In 1985 the International Cometary Explorer conducted the first comet flyby before joining the Halley Armada studying the famous comet The Deep Impact probe smashed into 9PTempel to learn more about its structure and composition and the Stardust mission returned samples of another comets tail The Philae lander successfully landed on Comet ChuryumovGerasimenko in 2014 as part of the broader Rosetta mission Deep space exploration edit Main article Deep space exploration This highresolution image of the Hubble Ultra Deep Field includes galaxies of various ages sizes shapes and colors The smallest reddest galaxies are some of the most distant galaxies to have been imaged by an optical telescope Deep space exploration is the branch of astronomy astronautics and space technology that is involved with the exploration of distant regions of outer space 49 Physical exploration of space is conducted both by human spaceflights and by robotic spacecraft Some of the best candidates for future deep space engine technologies include antimatter nuclear power and beamed propulsion 50 Beamed propulsion appears to be the best candidate for deep space exploration presently available since it uses known physics and known technology that is being developed for other purposes 51 Future of space exploration edit Main article Future of space exploration Concept art for a NASA Vision mission Artistic image of a rocket lifting from a Saturn moon Breakthrough Starshot edit Main article Breakthrough Starshot Breakthrough Starshot is a research and engineering project by the Breakthrough Initiatives to develop a proofofconcept fleet of light sail spacecraft named StarChip 52 to be capable of making the journey to the Alpha Centauri star system 437 lightyears away It was founded in 2016 by Yuri Milner Stephen Hawking and Mark Zuckerberg 53 54 Asteroids edit Main article Exploration of the asteroids An article in the science magazine Nature suggested the use of asteroids as a gateway for space exploration with the ultimate destination being Mars In order to make such an approach viable three requirements need to be fulfilled first a thorough asteroid survey to find thousands of nearby bodies suitable for astronauts to visit second extending flight duration and distance capability to everincreasing ranges out to Mars and finally developing better robotic vehicles and tools to enable astronauts to explore an asteroid regardless of its size shape or spin Furthermore using asteroids would provide astronauts with protection from galactic cosmic rays with mission crews being able to land on them without great risk to radiation exposure Artemis program edit Main article Artemis program The Artemis program is an ongoing crewed spaceflight program carried out by NASA US commercial spaceflight companies and international partners such as ESA 55 with the goal of landing the first woman and the next man on the Moon specifically at the lunar south pole region Artemis would be the next step towards the longterm goal of establishing a sustainable presence on the Moon laying the foundation for private companies to build a lunar economy and eventually sending humans to Mars In 2017 the lunar campaign was authorized by Space Policy Directive 1 using various ongoing spacecraft programs such as Orion the Lunar Gateway Commercial Lunar Payload Services and adding an undeveloped crewed lander The Space Launch System will serve as the primary launch vehicle for Orion while commercial launch vehicles are planned for use to launch other elements of the campaign 56 NASA requested 16 billion in additional funding for Artemis for fiscal year 2020 57 while the US Senate Appropriations Committee requested from NASA a fiveyear budget profile 58 which is needed for evaluation and approval by the US Congress 59 60 As of 2024 the first Artemis mission was launched in 2022 with the second mission a crewed lunar flyby planned for 2025 61 Construction on the Lunar Gateway is underway with initial capabilities set for the 20252027 timeframe 62 The first CLPS lander landed in 2024 marking the first US spacecraft to land since Apollo 17 63 Rationales edit Main article Space advocacy Astronaut Buzz Aldrin had a personal Communion service when he first arrived on the surface of the Moon The research that is conducted by national space exploration agencies such as NASA and Roscosmos is one of the reasons supporters cite to justify government expenses Economic analyses of the NASA programs often showed ongoing economic benefits generating many times the revenue of the cost of the program 64 It is also argued that space exploration would lead to the extraction of resources on other planets and especially asteroids which contain billions of dollars worth of minerals and metals Such expeditions could generate substantial revenue 65 In addition it has been argued that space exploration programs help inspire youth to study in science and engineering 66 Space exploration also gives scientists the ability to perform experiments in other settings and expand humanitys knowledge 67 Another claim is that space exploration is a necessity to humankind and that staying on Earth will eventually lead to extinction Some of the reasons are lack of natural resources comets nuclear war and worldwide epidemic Stephen Hawking renowned British theoretical physicist said I dont think the human race will survive the next thousand years unless we spread into space There are too many accidents that can befall life on a single planet But Im an optimist We will reach out to the stars 68 Author Arthur C Clarke presented a summary of motivations for the human exploration of space in his nonfiction semitechnical monograph Interplanetary Flight 69 He argued that humanitys choice is essentially between expansion off Earth into space versus cultural stagnation and death These motivations could be attributed to one of the first rocket scientists in NASA Wernher von Braun and his vision of humans moving beyond Earth The basis of this plan was to Develop multistage rockets capable of placing satellites animals and humans in space Development of large winged reusable spacecraft capable of carrying humans and equipment into Earth orbit in a way that made space access routine and costeffective Construction of a large permanently occupied space station to be used as a platform both to observe Earth and from which to launch deep space expeditions Launching the first human flights around the Moon leading to the first landings of humans on the Moon with the intent of exploring that body and establishing permanent lunar bases Assembly and fueling of spaceships in Earth orbit for the purpose of sending humans to Mars with the intent of eventually colonizing that planet 70 Known as the Von Braun Paradigm the plan was formulated to lead humans in the exploration of space Von Brauns vision of human space exploration served as the model for efforts in space exploration well into the twentyfirst century with NASA incorporating this approach into the majority of their projects 70 The steps were followed out of order as seen by the Apollo program reaching the moon before the space shuttle program was started which in turn was used to complete the International Space Station Von Brauns Paradigm formed NASAs drive for human exploration in the hopes that humans discover the far reaches of the universe NASA has produced a series of public service announcement videos supporting the concept of space exploration 71 Overall the US public remains largely supportive of both crewed and uncrewed space exploration According to an Associated Press Poll conducted in July 2003 71 of US citizens agreed with the statement that the space program is a good investment compared to 21 who did not 72 Human nature edit Space advocacy and space policy 73 regularly invokes exploration as a human nature 74 Topics edit Main articles Space science and Human presence in space Spaceflight edit Main articles Spaceflight and Astronautics Deltavs in kms for various orbital maneuvers Spaceflight is the use of space technology to achieve the flight of spacecraft into and through outer space Spaceflight is used in space exploration and also in commercial activities like space tourism and satellite telecommunications Additional noncommercial uses of spaceflight include space observatories reconnaissance satellites and other Earth observation satellites A spaceflight typically begins with a rocket launch which provides the initial thrust to overcome the force of gravity and propels the spacecraft from the surface of Earth Once in space the motion of a spacecraftboth when unpropelled and when under propulsionis covered by the area of study called astrodynamics Some spacecraft remain in space indefinitely some disintegrate during atmospheric reentry and others reach a planetary or lunar surface for landing or impact Satellites edit Main article Satellite Satellites are used for a large number of purposes Common types include military and civilian Earth observation satellites communication satellites navigation satellites weather satellites and research satellites Space stations and human spacecraft in orbit are also satellites Commercialization of space edit Main article Commercialization of space The commercialization of space first started out with the launching of private satellites by NASA or other space agencies Current examples of the commercial satellite use of space include satellite navigation systems satellite television satellite communications and satellite radio The next step of commercialization of space was seen as human spaceflight Flying humans safely to and from space had become routine to NASA and Russia 75 Reusable spacecraft were an entirely new engineering challenge something only seen in novels and films like Star Trek and War of the Worlds Astronaut Buzz Aldrin supported the use of making a reusable vehicle like the space shuttle Aldrin held that reusable spacecraft were the key in making space travel affordable stating that the use of passenger space travel is a huge potential market big enough to justify the creation of reusable launch vehicles 76 Space tourism is a next step in the use of reusable vehicles in the commercialization of space The purpose of this form of space travel is personal pleasure Private spaceflight companies such as SpaceX and Blue Origin and commercial space stations such as the Axiom Space and the Bigelow Commercial Space Station have changed the cost and overall landscape of space exploration and are expected to continue to do so in the near future Alien life edit Main articles Astrobiology and Extraterrestrial life Astrobiology is the interdisciplinary study of life in the universe combining aspects of astronomy biology and geology 77 It is focused primarily on the study of the origin distribution and evolution of life It is also known as exobiology 78 79 80 The term Xenobiology has been used as well but this is technically incorrect because its terminology means biology of the foreigners 81 Astrobiologists must also consider the possibility of life that is chemically entirely distinct from any life found on Earth 82 In the Solar System some of the prime locations for current or past astrobiology are on Enceladus Europa Mars and Titan 83 Human spaceflight and habitation edit Main articles Human spaceflight Bioastronautics Effect of spaceflight on the human body Space medicine Space architecture Space station Space habitat and Space habitat Crew quarters on Zvezda the base ISS crew module To date the longest human occupation of space is the International Space Station which has been in continuous use for 24 years 90 days Valeri Polyakov s record single spaceflight of almost 438 days aboard the Mir space station has not been surpassed The health effects of space have been well documented through years of research conducted in the field of aerospace medicine Analog environments similar to those experienced in space travel have been used in this research to further explore the relationship between isolation and extreme environments 84 It is imperative that the health of the crew be maintained as any deviation from baseline may compromise the integrity of the mission as well as the safety of the crew hence the astronauts must endure rigorous medical screenings and tests prior to embarking on any missions However it does not take long for the environmental dynamics of spaceflight to commence its toll on the human body for example space motion sickness a condition which affects the neurovestibular system and culminates in mild to severe signs and symptoms such as vertigo dizziness fatigue nausea and disorientation plagues almost all space travelers within their first few days in orbit 84 Space travel can also have an impact on the psyche of the crew members as delineated in anecdotal writings composed after their retirement Space travel can adversely affect the bodys natural biological clock sleep patterns causing sleep deprivation and fatigue and social interaction consequently residing in a Low Earth Orbit environment for a prolonged amount of time can result in both mental and physical exhaustion 84 Longterm stays in space reveal issues with bone and muscle loss in low gravity immune system suppression problems with eyesight and radiation exposure The lack of gravity causes fluid to rise upward which can cause pressure to build up in the eye resulting in vision problems the loss of bone minerals and densities cardiovascular deconditioning and decreased endurance and muscle mass 85 Radiation is an insidious health hazard to space travelers as it is invisible and can cause cancer When above the Earths magnetic field spacecraft are no longer protected from the suns radiation the danger of radiation is even more potent in deep space The hazards of radiation can be ameliorated through protective shielding on the spacecraft alerts and dosimetry 86 Fortunately with new and rapidly evolving technological advancements those in Mission Control are able to monitor the health of their astronauts more closely using telemedicine One may not be able to completely evade the physiological effects of space flight but those effects can be mitigated For example medical systems aboard space vessels such as the International Space Station are well equipped and designed to counteract the effects of lack of gravity and weightlessness onboard treadmills can help prevent muscle loss and reduce the risk of developing premature osteoporosis 84 86 Additionally a crew medical officer is appointed for each ISS mission and a flight surgeon is available 247 via the ISS Mission Control Center located in Houston Texas 86 Although the interactions are intended to take place in real time communications between the space and terrestrial crew may become delayed sometimes by as much as 20 minutes 86 as their distance from each other increases when the spacecraft moves further out of low Earth orbit because of this the crew are trained and need to be prepared to respond to any medical emergencies that may arise on the vessel as the ground crew are hundreds of miles away Many past and current concepts for the continued exploration and colonization of space focus on a return to the Moon as a steppingstone to the other planets especially Mars At the end of 2006 NASA announced they were planning to build a permanent Moon base with continual presence by 2024 87 Beyond the technical factors that could make living in space more widespread it has been suggested that the lack of private property the inability or difficulty in establishing property rights in space has been an impediment to the development of space for human habitation Since the advent of space technology in the latter half of the twentieth century the ownership of property in space has been murky with strong arguments both for and against In particular the making of national territorial claims in outer space and on celestial bodies has been specifically proscribed by the Outer Space Treaty which had been as of 2012 update ratified by all spacefaring nations 88 Space colonization also called space settlement and space humanization would be the permanent autonomous human habitation of locations outside Earth especially of natural satellites or planets such as the Moon or Mars using significant amounts of insitu resource utilization Human representation and participation edit See also Space law Participation and representation of humanity in space is an issue ever since the first phase of space exploration 89 Some rights of nonspacefaring countries have been mostly secured through international space law declaring space the province of all mankind understanding spaceflight as its resource though sharing of space for all humanity is still criticized as imperialist and lacking 89 Additionally to international inclusion the inclusion of women and people of colour has also been lacking To reach a more inclusive spaceflight some organizations like the Justspace Alliance 89 and IAU featured Inclusive Astronomy 90 have been formed in recent years Women edit Main article Women in space The first woman to go to space was Valentina Tereshkova She flew in 1963 but it was not until the 1980s that another woman entered space again All astronauts were required to be military test pilots at the time and women were not able to join this career This is one reason for the delay in allowing women to join space crews citation needed After the rule changed Svetlana Savitskaya became the second woman to go to space she was also from the Soviet Union Sally Ride became the next woman in space and the first woman to fly to space through the United States program Since then eleven other countries have allowed women astronauts The first allfemale space walk occurred in 2018 including Christina Koch and Jessica Meir They had both previously participated in space walks with NASA The first woman to go to the Moon is planned for 2026 Despite these developments women are underrepresented among astronauts and especially cosmonauts Issues that block potential applicants from the programs and limit the space missions they are able to go on include agencies limiting women to half as much time in space than men arguing that there may be unresearched additional risks for cancer

OSIRISREx Juno in launch configuration Juno is a NASA space probe orbiting the planet Jupiter It was built by Lockheed Martin and is operated by NASA s Jet Propulsion Laboratory The spacecraft was launched from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station on August 5 2011 UTC as part of the New Frontiers program 6 Juno entered a polar orbit of Jupiter on July 5 2016 UTC 4 7 to begin a scientific investigation of the planet 8 After completing its mission Juno was originally planned to be intentionally deorbited into Jupiters atmosphere 8 but has since been approved to continue orbiting until contact is lost with the spacecraft Juno s mission is to measure Jupiters composition gravitational field magnetic field and polar magnetosphere It will also search for clues about how the planet formed including whether it has a rocky core the amount of water present within the deep atmosphere mass distribution and its deep winds which can reach speeds up to 620 kmh 9 Juno is the second spacecraft to orbit Jupiter after the nuclear powered Galileo orbiter which orbited from 1995 to 2003 8 Unlike all earlier spacecraft sent to the outer planets 8 Juno is powered by solar panels commonly used by satellites orbiting Earth and working in the inner Solar System whereas radioisotope thermoelectric generators are commonly used for missions to the outer Solar System and beyond For Juno however the three largest solar panel wings ever deployed on a planetary probe play an integral role in stabilizing the spacecraft as well as generating power 10 Naming edit Juno s name comes from Greek and Roman mythology The god Jupiter drew a veil of clouds around himself to hide his mischief and his wife the goddess Juno was able to peer through the clouds and reveal Jupiters true nature NASA 11 A NASA compilation of mission names and acronyms referred to the mission by the backronym Jupiter Nearpolar Orbiter 12 However the project itself has consistently described it as a name with mythological associations 13 and not an acronym The spacecrafts current name is in reference to the Roman goddess Juno 11 Juno is sometimes called the New Frontiers 2 as the second mission in the New Frontiers program 14 15 but is not to be confused with New Horizons 2 a proposed but unselected New Frontiers mission Overview edit Juno s interplanetary trajectory tick marks at 30day intervals Juno spacecraft trajectory animation Animation of Juno s trajectory from August 5 2011 Juno Earth Mars Jupiter Juno was selected on June 9 2005 as the next New Frontiers mission after New Horizons 16 The desire for a Jupiter probe was strong in the years prior to this but there had not been any approved missions 17 18 The Discovery Program had passed over the somewhat similar but more limited Interior Structure and Internal Dynamical Evolution of Jupiter proposal 18 and the turnofthecentury era Europa Orbiter was canceled in 2002 17 The flagshiplevel Europa Jupiter System Mission was in the works in the early 2000s but funding issues resulted in it evolving into ESAs Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer 19 Juno completed a fiveyear cruise to Jupiter arriving on July 5 2016 7 The spacecraft traveled a total distance of roughly 28 10 9 km to reach Jupiter 20 The spacecraft was designed to orbit Jupiter 37 times over the course of its mission This was originally planned to take 20 months 4 5 Juno s trajectory used a gravity assist speed boost from Earth accomplished by an Earth flyby in October 2013 two years after its launch on August 5 2011 21 The spacecraft performed an orbit insertion burn to slow it enough to allow capture It was expected to make three 53day orbits before performing another burn on December 11 2016 that would bring it into a 14day polar orbit called the Science Orbit Because of a suspected problem in Juno s main engine the burn scheduled on December 11 2016 was cancelled and Juno remained in its 53day orbit until the first Ganymede encounter of its Extended Mission 22 This extended mission began with a flyby of Ganymede on June 7 2021 23 24 Subsequent flybys of Europa and then Io will further decrease the orbital period to 33 days by February 2024 25 During the science mission infrared and microwave instruments will measure the thermal radiation emanating from deep within Jupiters atmosphere These observations will complement previous studies of its composition by assessing the abundance and distribution of water and therefore oxygen This data will provide insight into Jupiters origins Juno will also investigate the convection that drives natural circulation patterns in Jupiters atmosphere Other instruments aboard Juno will gather data about its gravitational field and polar magnetosphere The Juno mission was planned to conclude in February 2018 after completing 37 orbits of Jupiter but now has been commissioned through 2025 to do a further 42 additional orbits of Jupiter as well as close flybys of Ganymede Europa and Io 26 The probe was then intended to be deorbited and burnt up in Jupiters outer atmosphere 4 5 to avoid any possibility of impact and biological contamination of one of its moons 27 Flight trajectory edit Juno awaiting its launch in 2011 Launch edit Juno was launched atop an Atlas V at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station Florida on August 5 2011 162500 UTC The Atlas V used a Russianbuilt RD180 main engine powered by kerosene and liquid oxygen The main engine ignited and underwent checkout then 38 seconds later the five strapon solid rocket boosters ignited Following the SRB burnout about 93 seconds into the flight two of the spent boosters fell away from the vehicle followed 15 seconds later by the remaining three When heating levels had dropped below predetermined limits the payload fairing that protected Juno during launch and transit through the thickest part of the atmosphere separated about 3 minutes 24 seconds into the flight The Atlas V main engine cut off 4 minutes 26 seconds after liftoff Sixteen seconds later the Centaur second stage ignited and it burned for about 6 minutes putting the satellite into an initial parking orbit 28 The vehicle coasted for about 30 minutes and then the Centaur was reignited for a second firing of 9 minutes placing the spacecraft on an Earth escape trajectory in a heliocentric orbit 28 Prior to separation the Centaur stage used onboard reaction engines to spin Juno up to 14 rpm About 54 minutes after launch the spacecraft separated from the Centaur and began to extend its solar panels 28 Following the full deployment and locking of the solar panels Juno s batteries began to recharge Deployment of the solar panels reduced Juno s spin rate by twothirds The probe is spun to ensure stability during the voyage and so that all instruments on the probe are able to observe Jupiter 27 29 The voyage to Jupiter took five years and included two orbital maneuvers in August and September 2012 and a flyby of the Earth on October 9 2013 30 31 When it reached the Jovian system Juno had traveled approximately 19 astronomical units 32 Atlas V on launch pad Liftoff Launch video Flyby of the Earth edit South America 33 as seen by JunoCam on its October 2013 Earth flyby Video of Earth and Moon taken by the Juno spacecraft After traveling for about a year in an elliptical heliocentric orbit Juno fired its engine twice in 2012 near aphelion to change its orbit and return to pass by the Earth at a distance of 559 kilometers in October 2013 30 It used Earths gravity to help slingshot itself toward the Jovian system in a maneuver called a gravity assist 34 The spacecraft received a boost in speed of more than 39 kms and it was set on a course to Jupiter 34 35 36 The flyby was also used as a rehearsal for the Juno science team to test some instruments and practice certain procedures before the arrival at Jupiter 34 37 Insertion into Jovian orbit edit Jupiters gravity accelerated the approaching spacecraft to around 210000 kmh 38 On July 5 2016 between 0318 and 0353 UTC Earthreceived time an insertion burn lasting 2102 seconds decelerated Juno by 542 ms 39 and changed its trajectory from a hyperbolic flyby to an elliptical polar orbit with a period of about 535 days 40 The spacecraft successfully entered Jovian orbit on July 5 2016 at 0353 UTC 3 Orbit and environment edit Juno s elliptical orbit and the Jovian radiation belts Juno s highly elliptical initial polar orbit takes it within 4200 km of the planet and out to 81 10 6 km far beyond Callisto s orbit An eccentricity reducing burn called the Period Reduction Maneuver was planned that would drop the probe into a much shorter 14 day science orbit 41 Originally Juno was expected to complete 37 orbits over 20 months before the end of its mission Due to problems with helium valves that are important during main engine burns mission managers announced on February 17 2017 that Juno would remain in its original 53day orbit since the chance of an engine misfire putting the spacecraft into a bad orbit was too high 22 Juno completed only 12 science orbits before the end of its budgeted mission plan ending July 2018 42 In June 2018 NASA extended the mission through July 2021 as described below The orbits were carefully planned in order to minimize contact with Jupiters dense radiation belts which can damage spacecraft electronics and solar panels by exploiting a gap in the radiation envelope near the planet passing through a region of minimal radiation 8 43 The Juno Radiation Vault with 1centimeterthick titanium walls also aids in protecting Juno s electronics by reducing the incoming radiation by a factor of 800 44 Despite the intense radiation JunoCam and the Jovian Infrared Auroral Mapper are expected to endure at least eight orbits while the Microwave Radiometer should endure at least eleven orbits 45 Although the flux of electrons close to Jupiter is about ten times as high as it is around Jupiters moon Europa 46 Juno will still receive a lower total dose of radiation in its polar orbit 47 than the Galileo orbiter received in its equatorial orbit Galileo s subsystems were damaged by radiation during its mission including an LED in its data recording system 48 Orbital operations edit Animation of Juno s trajectory around Jupiter from June 1 2016 to October 25 2025 Juno Jupiter Ganymede photographed on 7 June 2021 by Juno during its extended mission The spacecraft completed its first flyby of Jupiter on August 26 2016 and captured the first images of the planets north pole 49 On October 14 2016 days prior to perijove 2 and the planned Period Reduction Maneuver telemetry showed that some of Juno s helium valves were not opening properly 50 On October 18 2016 some 13 hours before its second close approach to Jupiter Juno entered into safe mode an operational mode engaged when its onboard computer encounters unexpected conditions The spacecraft powered down all noncritical systems and reoriented itself to face the Sun to gather the most power Due to this no science operations were conducted during perijove 2 51 On December 11 2016 the spacecraft completed perijove 3 with all but one instrument operating and returning data One instrument JIRAM was off pending a flight software update 52 Perijove 4 occurred on February 2 2017 with all instruments operating 22 Perijove 5 occurred on March 27 2017 53 Perijove 6 took place on May 19 2017 53 54 Although the missions lifetime is inherently limited by radiation exposure almost all of this dose was planned to be acquired during the perijoves As of 2017 update the 534 day orbit was planned to be maintained through July 2018 for a total of twelve sciencegathering perijoves At the end of this prime mission the project was planned to go through a science review process by NASAs Planetary Science Division to determine if it will receive funding for an extended mission 22 In June 2018 NASA extended the mission operations plan to July 2021 55 In January 2021 NASA extended the mission operations to September 2025 56 In this phase Juno began to examine Jupiters inner moons Ganymede Europa and Io A flyby of Ganymede occurred on June 7 2021 1735 UTC coming within 1038 km the closest any spacecraft has come to the moon since Galileo in 2000 23 24 57 A flyby of Europa took place on September 29 2022 at a distance of 352 km 58 59 Juno performed two flybys of Io on December 30 2023 and February 3 2024 gathering observational data on volcanic activity From April 2024 Juno will begin a series of experiments to learn more about Jupiters interior shape and structure 60 Planned deorbit and disintegration edit NASA originally planned to deorbit the spacecraft into the atmosphere of Jupiter after completing 32 orbits of Jupiter but has since extended the mission to September 2025 61 56 The controlled deorbit is intended to eliminate space debris and risks of contamination in accordance with NASAs planetary protection guidelines 62 63 64 Team edit Scott Bolton of the Southwest Research Institute in San Antonio Texas is the principal investigator and is responsible for all aspects of the mission The Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California manages the mission and the Lockheed Martin Corporation was responsible for the spacecraft development and construction The mission is being carried out with the participation of several institutional partners Coinvestigators include Toby Owen of the University of Hawaii Andrew Ingersoll of California Institute of Technology Frances Bagenal of the University of Colorado at Boulder and Candy Hansen of the Planetary Science Institute Jack Connerney of the Goddard Space Flight Center served as instrument lead 65 66 Cost edit Juno was originally proposed at a cost of approximately US700 million for a launch in June 2009 NASA budgetary restrictions resulted in postponement until August 2011 and a launch on board an Atlas V rocket in the 551 configuration As of 2019 update the mission was projected to cost US146 billion for operations and data analysis through 2022 67 Scientific objectives edit Jupiter imaged using the VISIR instrument on the VLT These observations will inform the work to be undertaken by Juno 68 The Juno spacecrafts suite of science instruments will 69 Determine the ratio of oxygen to hydrogen effectively measuring the abundance of water in Jupiter which will help distinguish among prevailing theories linking Jupiters formation to the Solar System Obtain a better estimate of Jupiters core mass which will also help distinguish among prevailing theories linking Jupiters formation to the Solar System Precisely map Jupiters gravitational field to assess the distribution of mass in Jupiters interior including properties of its structure and dynamics Precisely map Jupiters magnetic field to assess the origin and structure of the field and the depth at which the planets magnetic field is created This experiment will also help scientists understand the fundamental physics of dynamo theory Map the variation in atmospheric composition temperature structure cloud opacity and dynamics to pressures far greater than 100 bar at all latitudes Characterize and explore the threedimensional structure of Jupiters polar magnetosphere and auroras 69 Measure the orbital framedragging known also as LenseThirring precession caused by the angular momentum of Jupiter 70 71 and possibly a new test of general relativity effects connected with the Jovian rotation 72 Scientific instruments edit The Juno missions scientific objectives are being achieved with a payload of nine instruments on board the spacecraft 73 74 75 76 77 Microwave radiometer edit Main article Microwave Radiometer Microwave Radiometer The microwave radiometer comprises six antennas mounted on two of the sides of the body of the probe They will perform measurements of electromagnetic waves on frequencies in the microwave range 600 MHz 12 24 48 96 and 22 GHz the only microwave frequencies which are able to pass through the thick Jovian atmosphere The radiometer will measure the abundance of water and ammonia in the deep layers of the atmosphere up to 200 bar pressure or 500600 km deep The combination of different wavelengths and the emission angle should make it possible to obtain a temperature profile at various levels of the atmosphere The data collected will determine how deep the atmospheric circulation is 78 79 The MWR is designed to function through orbit 11 of Jupiter 80 Jovian Infrared Auroral Mapper edit Main article Jovian Infrared Auroral Mapper Jovian Infrared Auroral Mapper The spectrometer mapper JIRAM operating in the near infrared conducts surveys in the upper layers of the atmosphere to a depth of between 50 and 70 km where the pressure reaches 5 to 7 bar JIRAM will provide images of the aurora in the wavelength of 34 m in regions with abundant H 3 ions By measuring the heat radiated by the atmosphere of Jupiter JIRAM can determine how clouds with water are flowing beneath the surface It can also detect methane water vapor ammonia and phosphine It was not required that this device meets the radiation resistance requirements 81 82 83 The JIRAM instrument is expected to operate through the eighth orbit of Jupiter 80 JIRAMs spincompensation mirror is stuck since PJ44 but the instrument is operational 84 Magnetometer edit Main article Magnetometer MAG The magnetic field investigation has three goals mapping of the magnetic field determining the dynamics of Jupiters interior and determination of the threedimensional structure of the polar magnetosphere The magnetometer experiment consists of the Flux Gate Magnetometer which will observe the strength and direction of the magnetic field lines and the Advanced Stellar Compass which will monitor the orientation of the magnetometer sensors 75 Gravity Science edit Main article Gravity Science Gravity Science The purpose of measuring gravity by radio waves is to establish a map of the distribution of mass inside Jupiter The uneven distribution of mass in Jupiter induces small variations in gravity all along the orbit followed by the probe when it runs closer to the surface of the planet These gravity variations drive small probe velocity changes The purpose of radio science is to detect the Doppler effect on radio broadcasts issued by Juno toward Earth in Kaband and Xband which are frequency ranges that can conduct the study with fewer disruptions related to the solar wind or Jupiter s ionosphere 85 86 74 Luciano Iess Sapienza University of Rome Jovian Auroral Distributions Experiment edit Main article Jovian Auroral Distributions Experiment JADE The energetic particle detector JADE will measure the angular distribution energy and the velocity vector of ions and electrons at low energy present in the aurora of Jupiter On JADE like JEDI the electron analyzers are installed on three sides of the upper plate which allows a measure of frequency three times higher 74 87 Jovian Energetic Particle Detector Instrument edit Main article Jovian Energetic Particle Detector Instrument JEDI The energetic particle detector JEDI will measure the angular distribution and the velocity vector of ions and electrons at high energy present in the polar magnetosphere of Jupiter JEDI has three identical sensors dedicated to the study of particular ions of hydrogen helium oxygen and sulfur 74 88 Radio and Plasma Wave Sensor edit Main article Waves Radio and Plasma Wave Sensor This instrument will identify the regions of auroral currents that define Jovian radio emissions and acceleration of the auroral particles by measuring the radio and plasma spectra in the auroral region It will also observe the interactions between Jupiters atmosphere and magnetosphere The instrument consists of two antennae that detect radio and plasma waves 75 Ultraviolet Spectrograph edit Main article UVS Ultraviolet Spectrograph UVS will record the wavelength position and arrival time of detected ultraviolet photons during the time when the spectrograph slit views Jupiter during each turn of the spacecraft The instrument will provide spectral images of the UV auroral emissions in the polar magnetosphere 75 JunoCam edit Main article JunoCam JunoCam A visible light cameratelescope included in the payload to facilitate education and public outreach later repurposed to study the dynamics of Jupiters clouds particularly those at the poles 89 It was anticipated that it would operate through only eight orbits of Jupiter ending in September 2017 90 due to the planets damaging radiation and magnetic field 80 but as of October 2023 JunoCam remains operational 91 Locations of Juno s science instruments Interactive 3D model of Juno Operational components edit Solar panels edit Illumination test on one of Juno s solar panels Juno is the first mission to Jupiter to use solar panels instead of the radioisotope thermoelectric generators used by Pioneer 10 Pioneer 11 the Voyager program Ulysses CassiniHuygens New Horizons and the Galileo orbiter 92 It is also the farthest solarpowered trip in the history of space exploration 93 Once in orbit around Jupiter Juno receives only 4 as much sunlight as it would on Earth but the global shortage of plutonium238 at the time 94 95 96 97 as well as advances made in solar cell technology over the past several decades makes it economically preferable to use solar panels of practical size to provide power at a distance of 5 au from the Sun 98 The Juno spacecraft uses three solar panels symmetrically arranged around the spacecraft Shortly after it cleared Earths atmosphere the panels were deployed Two of the panels have four hinged segments each and the third panel has three segments and a magnetometer Each panel is 27 by 89 m 99 providing 50 square metres of active cells 100 101 the largest on any NASA deepspace probe at the time of launching 102 The combined mass of the three panels is nearly 340 kg 103 If the panels were optimized to operate at Earth they would produce 12 to 14 kilowatts of power Only about 486 watts were generated when Juno arrived at Jupiter projected to decline to near 420 watts as radiation degrades the cells 104 The solar panels will remain in sunlight continuously from launch through the end of the mission except for short periods during the operation of the main engine and eclipses by Jupiter A central power distribution and drive unit monitors the power that is generated by the solar panels and distributes it to instruments heaters and experiment sensors as well as to batteries that are charged when excess power is available Two 55 Ah lithiumion batteries that are able to withstand the radiation environment of Jupiter provide power when Juno passes through eclipse 105 Telecommunications edit Juno s highgain antenna dish being installed Juno uses inband signaling for several critical operations as well as status reporting during cruise mode 106 but it is expected to be used infrequently Communications are via the 34 m and 70 m antennas of the NASA Deep Space Network utilizing an Xband direct link 105 The command and data processing of the Juno spacecraft includes a flight computer capable of providing about 50 Mbits of instrument throughput Gravity science subsystems use the Xband and K a band Doppler tracking and autoranging 107 Due to telecommunications constraints Juno will only be able to return about 40 megabytes of JunoCam data during each 11day orbital period limiting the number of images that are captured and transmitted during each orbit to somewhere between 10 and 100 depending on the compression level used 108 needs update The overall amount of data downlinked on each orbit is significantly higher and used for the missions scientific instruments JunoCam is intended for public outreach and is thus secondary to the science data This is comparable to the previous Galileo mission that orbited Jupiter which captured thousands of images 109 despite its slow data rate of 1000 bits due to the failure of its high gain antenna The communication system is also used as part of the Gravity Science experiment 110 Propulsion edit Juno uses a LEROS 1b main engine with hypergolic propellant manufactured by Moog Inc in Westcott Buckinghamshire England 111 It uses approx 2000 kg of hydrazine and nitrogen tetroxide for propulsion including 1232 kg available for the Jupiter Orbit Insertion plus subsequent orbital maneuvers The engine provides a thrust of 645 newtons The engine bell is enclosed in a debris shield fixed to the spacecraft body and is used for major burns For control of the vehicles orientation and to perform trajectory correction maneuvers Juno utilizes a monopropellant reaction control system consisting of twelve small thrusters that are mounted on four engine modules 105 Galileo plaque and minifigures edit Galileo Galilei plaque Juno carries a plaque to Jupiter dedicated to Galileo Galilei The plaque was provided by the Italian Space Agency and measures 71 by 51 cm It is made of flightgrade aluminum and weighs 6 g 112 The plaque depicts a portrait of Galileo and a text in Galileos own handwriting penned in January 1610 while observing what would later be known to be the Galilean moons 112 The text translates as On the 11th it was in this formation and the star closest to Jupiter was half the size than the other and very close to the other so that during the previous nights all of the three observed stars looked of the same dimension and among them equally afar so that it is evident that around Jupiter there are three moving stars invisible till this time to everyone The spacecraft also carries three Lego minifigures representing Galileo Galilei the Roman god Jupiter and his sister and wife the goddess Juno In Roman mythology Jupiter drew a veil of clouds around himself to hide his mischief Juno was able to peer through the clouds and reveal Jupiters true nature The Juno minifigure holds a magnifying glass as a sign of searching for the truth and Jupiter holds a lightning bolt The third Lego crew member Galileo Galilei has his telescope with him on the journey 113 The figurines were produced in partnership between NASA and Lego as part of an outreach program to inspire childrens interest in science technology engineering and mathematics 114 Although most Lego toys are made of plastic Lego specially made these minifigures of aluminum to endure the extreme conditions of space flight 115 Scientific results edit Among early results Juno gathered information about Jovian lightning that revised earlier theories 116 Juno provided the first views of Jupiters north pole as well as providing insight about Jupiters aurorae magnetic field and atmosphere 117 In 2021 analysis of the frequency of interplanetary dust impacts as Juno passed between Earth and the asteroid belt indicated that this dust which causes the Zodiacal light comes from Mars rather than from comets or asteroids that come from the outer solar system as was previously thought 118 Juno made many discoveries that are challenging existing theories about Jupiters formation When Juno flew over the poles of Jupiter it imaged clusters of stable cyclones that exist at the poles 119 It found that the magnetosphere of Jupiter is uneven and chaotic Using its Microwave Radiometer Juno found that the red and white bands that can be seen on Jupiter extend hundreds of kilometers into the Jovian atmosphere yet the interior of Jupiter is not evenly mixed This has resulted in the theory that Jupiter does not have a solid core as previously thought but a fuzzy core made of pieces of rock and metallic hydrogen This peculiar core may be a result of a collision that happened early on in Jupiters formation 120 In April 2020 Juno detected a meteor impact on Jupiter with estimated mass of 2505000 kg 121 Results from Juno on storms suggests that they are far taller than expected with some extending 60 miles below the cloud tops and others including the Great Red Spot extending over 200 miles With Juno traveling low over Jupiters cloud deck at about 130000 mph Juno scientists were able to measure velocity changes as small 001 millimeter per second using a NASAs Deep Space Network tracking antenna from a distance of more than 400 million miles This enabled the team to constrain the depth of the Great Red Spot to about 300 miles below the cloud tops The new results show that the cyclones are warmer on top with lower atmospheric densities while they are colder at the bottom with higher densities Anticyclones which rotate in the opposite direction are colder at the top but warmer at the bottom 122 Timeline edit Date Event Latitude 123 Longitude 123 August 5 2011 162500 Launched 124 August 5 2012 065700 Deep Space Maneuvers 125 126 September 3 2012 063000 October 9 2013

interstellar program A poster of the planets and moons visited during the Voyager program The Voyager program is an American scientific program that employs two interstellar probes Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 They were launched in 1977 to take advantage of a favorable planetary alignment to explore the two gas giants Jupiter and Saturn and potentially also the ice giants Uranus and Neptune to fly near them while collecting data for transmission back to Earth After Voyager 1 successfully completed its flyby of Saturn and its moon Titan it was decided to send Voyager 2 on flybys of Uranus and Neptune 1 After the planetary flybys were complete decisions were made to keep the probes in operation to explore interstellar space and the outer regions of the solar system On 25 August 2012 data from Voyager 1 indicated that it had entered interstellar space 2 On 5 November 2019 data from Voyager 2 indicated that it also had entered interstellar space 3 On 4 November 2019 scientists reported that on 5 November 2018 the Voyager 2 probe had officially reached the interstellar medium a region of outer space beyond the influence of the solar wind as did Voyager 1 in 2012 4 5 6 In August 2018 NASA confirmed based on results by the New Horizons spacecraft the existence of a hydrogen wall at the outer edges of the Solar System that was first detected in 1992 by the two Voyager spacecraft 7 8 9 As of 2024 update the Voyagers are still in operation beyond the outer boundary of the heliosphere in interstellar space Voyager 1 is moving with a velocity of 61198 kilometers per hour or 17 kms relative to the Sun and is 24475900000 kilometers from the Sun 10 reaching a distance of 162 AU from Earth as of May 25 2024 11 As of 2024 update Voyager 2 is moving with a velocity of 55347 kilometers per hour or 15 kms relative to the Sun and is 20439100000 kilometers from the Sun 12 reaching a distance of 136627 AU from Earth as of May 25 2024 11 The two Voyagers are the only humanmade objects to date that have passed into interstellar space a record they will hold until at least the 2040s and Voyager 1 is the farthest humanmade object from Earth 13 History edit Further information Grand Tour program Mariner JupiterSaturn edit See also Grand Tour program Mariner JupiterSaturn The trajectories that enabled the Voyager spacecraft to visit the outer planets and achieve velocity to escape the Solar System Plot of Voyager 2 s heliocentric velocity against its distance from the Sun illustrating the use of gravity assist to accelerate the spacecraft by Jupiter Saturn and Uranus To observe Triton Voyager 2 passed over Neptunes north pole resulting in an acceleration out of the plane of the ecliptic and reduced its velocity away from the Sun 14 Voyager did things no one predicted found scenes no one expected and promises to outlive its inventors Like a great painting or an abiding institution it has acquired an existence of its own a destiny beyond the grasp of its handlers Stephen J Pyne 1 The two Voyager space probes were originally conceived as part of the Planetary Grand Tour planned during the late 1960s and early 70s that aimed to explore Jupiter Saturn Saturns moon Titan Uranus Neptune and Pluto The mission originated from the Grand Tour program conceptualized by Gary Flandro an aerospace engineer at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in 1964 which leveraged a rare planetary alignment occurring once every 175 years 15 16 This alignment allowed a craft to reach all outer planets using gravitational assists The mission was to send several pairs of probes and gained momentum in 1966 when it was endorsed by NASA s Jet Propulsion Laboratory However in December 1971 the Grand Tour mission was canceled when funding was redirected to the Space Shuttle program 17 In 1972 a scaleddown mission was proposed utilizing a spacecraft derived from the Mariner series initially intended to be Mariner 11 and Mariner 12 The gravityassist technique successfully demonstrated by Mariner 10 would be used to achieve significant velocity changes by maneuvering through an intermediate planets gravitational field to minimize time towards Saturn 18 The spacecrafts were then moved into a separate program named Mariner JupiterSaturn part of the Mariner program later renamed because it was thought that the design of the two space probes had progressed sufficiently beyond that of the Mariner family to merit a separate name 20 Voyager probes edit Interactive 3D model of the Voyager spacecraft On March 4 1977 NASA announced a competition to rename the mission believing the existing name was not appropriate as the mission had differed significantly from previous Mariner missions Voyager was chosen as the new name referencing an earlier suggestion by William Pickering who had proposed the name Navigator Due to the name change occurring close to launch the probes were still occasionally referred to as Mariner 11 and Mariner 12 or even Voyager 11 and Voyager 12 17 Two mission trajectories were established JST aimed at Jupiter Saturn and enhancing a Titan flyby while JSX served as a contingency plan JST focused on a Titan flyby while JSX provided a flexible mission plan If JST succeeded JSX could proceed with the Grand Tour but in case of failure JSX could be redirected for a separate Titan flyby forfeiting the Grand Tour opportunity 18 The second probe now Voyager 2 followed the JSX trajectory granting it the option to continue on to Uranus and Neptune Upon Voyager 1 completing its main objectives at Saturn Voyager 2 received a mission extension enabling it to proceed to Uranus and Neptune This allowed Voyager 2 to diverge from the originally planned JST trajectory 17 The probes would be launched in August or September 1977 with their main objective being to compare the characteristics of Jupiter and Saturn such as their atmospheres magnetic fields particle environments ring systems and moons They would fly by planets and moons in either a JST or JSX trajectory After completing their flybys the probes would communicate with Earth relaying vital data using their magnetometers spectrometers and other instruments to detect interstellar solar and cosmic radiation Their radioisotope thermoelectric generators would limit the maximum communication time with the probes to roughly a decade Following their primary missions the probes would continue to drift into interstellar space 18 Voyager 2 was the first to be launched Its trajectory was designed to allow flybys of Jupiter Saturn Uranus and Neptune Voyager 1 was launched after Voyager 2 but along a shorter and faster trajectory that was designed to provide an optimal flyby of Saturns moon Titan 21 which was known to be quite large and to possess a dense atmosphere This encounter sent Voyager 1 out of the plane of the ecliptic ending its planetary science mission 22 Had Voyager 1 been unable to perform the Titan flyby the trajectory of Voyager 2 could have been altered to explore Titan forgoing any visit to Uranus and Neptune 23 Voyager 1 was not launched on a trajectory that would have allowed it to continue to Uranus and Neptune but could have continued from Saturn to Pluto without exploring Titan 24 During the 1990s Voyager 1 overtook the slower deepspace probes Pioneer 10 and Pioneer 11 to become the most distant humanmade object from Earth a record that it will keep for the foreseeable future The New Horizons probe which had a higher launch velocity than Voyager 1 is travelling more slowly due to the extra speed Voyager 1 gained from its flybys of Jupiter and Saturn Voyager 1 and Pioneer 10 are the most widely separated humanmade objects anywhere since they are travelling in roughly opposite directions from the Solar System In December 2004 Voyager 1 crossed the termination shock where the solar wind is slowed to subsonic speed and entered the heliosheath where the solar wind is compressed and made turbulent due to interactions with the interstellar medium On 10 December 2007 Voyager 2 also reached the termination shock about 16 billion kilometres closer to the Sun than from where Voyager 1 first crossed it indicating that the Solar System is asymmetrical 25 In 2010 Voyager 1 reported that the outward velocity of the solar wind had dropped to zero and scientists predicted it was nearing interstellar space 26 In 2011 data from the Voyagers determined that the heliosheath is not smooth but filled with giant magnetic bubbles theorized to form when the magnetic field of the Sun becomes warped at the edge of the Solar System 27 In June 2012 Scientists at NASA reported that Voyager 1 was very close to entering interstellar space indicated by a sharp rise in highenergy particles from outside the Solar System 28 29 In September 2013 NASA announced that Voyager 1 had crossed the heliopause on 25 August 2012 making it the first spacecraft to enter interstellar space 30 31 32 In December 2018 NASA announced that Voyager 2 had crossed the heliopause on 5 November 2018 making it the second spacecraft to enter interstellar space 3 As of 2017 update Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 continue to monitor conditions in the outer expanses of the Solar System 33 The Voyager spacecraft are expected to be able to operate science instruments through 2020 when limited power will require instruments to be deactivated one by one Sometime around 2025 there will no longer be sufficient power to operate any science instruments In July 2019 a revised power management plan was implemented to better manage the two probes dwindling power supply 34 Spacecraft design edit Voyager spacecraft diagram The Voyager spacecraft each weighed 815 kilograms at launch but after fuel usage are now about 733 kilograms 35 Of this weight each spacecraft carries 105 kilograms of scientific instruments 36 The identical Voyager spacecraft use threeaxisstabilized guidance systems that use gyroscopic and accelerometer inputs to their attitude control computers to point their highgain antennas towards the Earth and their scientific instruments towards their targets sometimes with the help of a movable instrument platform for the smaller instruments and the electronic photography system The diagram shows the highgain antenna with a 37 m diameter dish attached to the hollow decagonal electronics container There

configures each instrument and controls instrument operations It also collects engineering and science data and formats the data for transmission The DTR is used to record highrate Plasma Wave Subsystem data which is played back every six months The Imaging Science Subsystem made up of a wideangle and a narrowangle camera is a modified version of the slow scan vidicon camera designs that were used in the earlier Mariner flights The Imaging Science Subsystem consists of two televisiontype cameras each with eight filters in a commandable filter wheel mounted in front of the vidicons One has a low resolution 200 mm focal length wideangle lens with an aperture of f3 while the other uses a higher resolution 1500 mm narrowangle f85 lens Three spacecraft were built Voyager 1 Voyager 2 and

sometimes used for redundancy They are proprietary custombuilt computers built from CMOS and TTL mediumscale CMOS integrated circuits and discrete components mostly from the 7400 series of Texas Instruments 41 Total number of words among the six computers is about 32K Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 have identical computer systems 35 42 The Computer Command System the central controller of the spacecraft has two 18bit word interrupttype processors with 4096 words each of nonvolatile platedwire memory During most of the Voyager mission the two CCS computers on each spacecraft were used nonredundantly to increase the command and processing capability of the spacecraft The CCS is nearly identical to the system flown on the Viking spacecraft 43 The Flight Data System is two 16bit word machines with modular memories and 8198 words each The Attitude and Articulation Control System is two 18bit word machines with 4096 words each Unlike the other onboard instruments the operation of the cameras for visible light is not autonomous but rather it is controlled by an imaging parameter table contained in one of the onboard digital computers the Flight Data Subsystem More recent space probes since about 1990 usually have completely autonomous cameras The computer command subsystem controls the cameras The CCS contains fixed computer programs such as command decoding fault detection and correction routines antennapointing routines and spacecraft sequencing routines This computer is an improved version of the one that was used in the Viking orbiter 43 The hardware in both custombuilt CCS subsystems in the Voyagers is identical There is only a minor software modification for one of them that has a scientific subsystem that the other lacks According to Guinness Book of Records CCS holds record of longest period of continual operation for a computer It has been running continuously since 20 August 1977 44 The Attitude and Articulation Control Subsystem controls the spacecraft orientation It keeps the highgain antenna pointing towards the Earth controls attitude changes and points the scan platform The custombuilt AACS systems on both craft are identical It has been erroneously reported 45 on the Internet that the Voyager space probes were controlled by a version of the RCA 1802 but such claims are not supported by the primary design documents The CDP1802 microprocessor was used later in the Galileo space probe which was designed and built years later The digital control electronics of the Voyagers were not based on a microprocessor integratedcircuit chip Communications edit The uplink communications are executed via Sband microwave communications The downlink communications are carried out by an Xband microwave transmitter on board the spacecraft with an Sband transmitter as a backup All longrange communications to and from the two Voyagers have been carried out using their 37meter highgain antennas The highgain antenna has a beamwidth of 05 for Xband and 23 for Sband 46 17 46 17 Because of the inversesquare law in radio communications the digital data rates used in the downlinks from the Voyagers have been continually decreasing the farther that they get from the Earth For example the data rate used from Jupiter was about 115000 bits per second That was halved at the distance of Saturn and it has gone down continually since then 46 Some measures were taken on the ground along the way to reduce the effects of the inversesquare law In between 1982 and 1985 the diameters of the three main parabolic dish antennas of the Deep Space Network were increased from 64 to 70 m 46 34 dramatically increasing their areas for gathering weak microwave signals Whilst the craft were between Saturn and Uranus the onboard software was upgraded to do a degree of image compression and to use a more efficient ReedSolomon errorcorrecting encoding 46 33 Then between 1986 and 1989 new techniques were brought into play to combine the signals from multiple antennas on the ground into one more powerful signal in a kind of an antenna array 46 34 This was done at Goldstone California Canberra and Madrid using the additional dish antennas available there Also in Australia the Parkes Radio Telescope was brought into the array in time for the flyby of Neptune in 1989 In the United States the Very Large Array in New Mexico was brought into temporary use along with the antennas of the Deep Space Network at Goldstone 46 34 Using this new technology of antenna arrays helped to compensate for the immense radio distance from Neptune to the Earth Power edit RTGs for the Voyager program Electrical power is supplied by three MHWRTG radioisotope thermoelectric generators They are powered by plutonium238 and provided approximately 470 W at 30 volts DC when the spacecraft was launched Plutonium238 decays with a halflife of 8774 years 47 so RTGs using Pu238 will lose a factor of 105 079 of their power output per year In 2011 34 years after launch the thermal power generated by such an RTG would be reduced to 76 of its initial power The RTG thermocouples which convert thermal power into electricity also degrade over time reducing available electric power below this calculated level By 7 October 2011 the power generated by Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 had dropped to 2679 W and 2692 W respectively about 57 of the power at launch The level of power output was better than prelaunch predictions based on a conservative thermocouple degradation model As the electrical power decreases spacecraft loads must be turned off eliminating some capabilities There may be insufficient power for communications by 2032 48 Voyager Interstellar Mission edit Voyager 1 crossed the heliopause or the edge of the heliosphere in August 2012 Voyager 2 crossed the heliosheath in November 2018 3 49 The Voyager primary mission was completed in 1989 with the close flyby of Neptune by Voyager 2 The Voyager Interstellar Mission is a mission extension which began when the two spacecraft had already been in flight for over 12 years 50 The Heliophysics Division of the NASA Science Mission Directorate conducted a Heliophysics Senior Review in 2008 The panel found that the VIM is a mission that is absolutely imperative to continue and that VIM funding near the optimal level and increased DSN support is warranted 51 The main objective of the VIM was to extend the exploration of the Solar System beyond the outer planets to the heliopause and if possible even beyond Voyager 1 crossed the heliopause boundary in 2012 followed by Voyager 2 in 2018 Passing through the heliopause boundary has allowed both spacecraft to make measurements of the interstellar fields particles and waves unaffected by the solar wind Two significant findings so far have been the discovery of a region of magnetic bubbles 52 and no indication of an expected shift in the Solar magnetic field 53 The entire Voyager 2 scan platform including all of the platform instruments was switched off in 1998 All platform instruments on Voyager 1 except for the ultraviolet spectrometer 54 have also been switched off The Voyager 1 scan platform was scheduled to go offline in late 2000 but has been left on to investigate UV emission from the upwind direction UVS data are still captured but scans are no longer possible 55 Gyro operations ended in 2016 for Voyager 2 and in 2017 for Voyager 1 Gyro operations are used to rotate the probe 360 degrees six times per year to measure the magnetic field of the spacecraft which is then subtracted from the magnetometer science data The two spacecraft continue to operate with some loss in subsystem redundancy but retain the capability to return scientific data from a full complement of Voyager Interstellar Mission science instruments Both spacecraft also have adequate electrical power and attitude control propellant to continue operating until around 2025 after which there may not be electrical power to support science instrument operation science data return and spacecraft operations will cease 56 Mission details edit This diagram about the heliosphere was released on 28 June 2013 and incorporates results from the Voyager spacecraft 57 By the start of VIM Voyager 1 was at a distance of 40 AU from the Earth while Voyager 2 was at 31 AU VIM is in three phases termination shock heliosheath exploration and interstellar exploration phase The spacecraft began VIM in an environment controlled by the Suns magnetic field with the plasma particles being dominated by those contained in the expanding supersonic solar wind This is the characteristic environment of the termination shock phase At some distance from the Sun the supersonic solar wind will be held back from further expansion by the interstellar wind The first feature encountered by a spacecraft as a result of this interaction between interstellar wind and solar wind was the termination shock where the solar wind slows to subsonic speed and large changes in plasma flow direction and magnetic field orientation occur Voyager 1 completed the phase of termination shock in December 2004 at a distance of 94 AU while Voyager 2 completed it in August 2007 at a distance of 84 AU After entering into the heliosheath the spacecraft were in an area that is dominated by the Suns magnetic field and solar wind particles After passing through the heliosheath the two Voyagers began the phase of interstellar exploration The outer boundary of the heliosheath is called the heliopause This is the region where the Suns influence begins to decrease and interstellar space can be detected 58 Voyager 1 is escaping the Solar System at the speed of 36 AU per year 35 north of the ecliptic in the general direction of the solar apex in Hercules while Voyager 2 s speed is about 33 AU per year heading 48 south of the ecliptic The Voyager spacecraft will eventually go on to the stars In about 40000 years Voyager 1 will be within 16 light years of AC79 3888 also known as Gliese 445 which is approaching the Sun In 40000 years Voyager 2 will be within 17 ly of Ross 248 and in 296000 years it will pass within 46 ly of Sirius which is the brightest star in the nightsky 2 The spacecraft are not expected to collide with a star for 1 sextillion years 59 In October 2020 astronomers reported a significant unexpected increase in density in the space beyond the Solar System as detected by the Voyager space probes According to the researchers this implies that the density gradient is a largescale feature of the VLISM in the general direction of the heliospheric nose 60 61 Voyager Golden Record edit Main article Voyager Golden Record The cover of the golden record Both spacecraft carry a 12inch golden phonograph record that contains pictures and sounds of Earth symbolic directions on the cover for playing the record and data detailing the location of Earth 33 29 The record is intended as a combination time capsule and an interstellar message to any civilization alien or farfuture human that may recover either of the Voyagers The contents of this record were selected by a committee that included Timothy Ferris and was chaired by Carl Sagan 29 Pale Blue Dot edit Main article Pale Blue Dot Seen from 6 billion kilometers Earth appears as a pale blue dot Pale Blue Dot is a photograph of Earth taken on February 14 1990 by the Voyager 1 space probe from a distance of approximately 6 billion kilometers as part of that days Family Portrait series of images of the Solar System 62 The Voyager programs discoveries during the primary phase of its mission including new closeup color photos of the major planets were regularly documented by print and electronic media outlets Among the bestknown of these is an image of the Earth as a Pale Blue Dot taken in 1990 by Voyager 1 and popularized by Carl Sagan 63 Consider again that dot Thats here Thats home Thats usThe Earth is a very small stage in a vast cosmic arena To my mind there is perhaps no better demonstration of the folly of human conceits than this distant image of our tiny world To me it underscores our responsibility to deal more kindly and compassionately with one another and to preserve and cherish that pale blue dot the only home weve ever known See also edit Family Portrait The Farthest a 2017

Kepler space telescope is a defunct space telescope launched by NASA in 2009 5 to discover Earthsized planets orbiting other stars 6 7 Named after astronomer Johannes Kepler 8 the spacecraft was launched into an Earthtrailing heliocentric orbit The principal investigator was William J Borucki After nine and a half years of operation the telescopes reaction control system fuel was depleted and NASA announced its retirement on October 30 2018 9 10 Designed to survey a portion of Earths region of the Milky Way to discover Earthsize exoplanets in or near habitable zones and to estimate how many of the billions of stars in the Milky Way have such planets 6 11 12 Keplers sole scientific instrument is a photometer that continually monitored the brightness of approximately 150000 main sequence stars in a fixed field of view 13 These data were transmitted to Earth then analyzed to detect periodic dimming caused by exoplanets that cross in front of their host star Only planets whose orbits are seen edgeon from Earth could be detected Kepler observed 530506 stars and had detected 2778 confirmed planets as of June 16 2023 14 15 History edit Prelaunch development edit The Kepler space telescope was part of NASAs Discovery Program of relatively lowcost science missions The telescopes construction and initial operation were managed by NASAs Jet Propulsion Laboratory with Ball Aerospace responsible for developing the Kepler flight system 16 In January 2006 the projects launch was delayed eight months because of budget cuts and consolidation at NASA 17 It was delayed again by four months in March 2006 due to fiscal problems 17 During this time the highgain antenna was changed from a design using a gimbal to one fixed to the frame of the spacecraft to reduce cost and complexity at the cost of one observation day per month 18 Post launch edit The Ames Research Center was responsible for the ground system development mission operations since December 2009 and scientific data analysis The initial planned lifetime was three and a half years 19 but greaterthanexpected noise in the data from both the stars and the spacecraft meant additional time was needed to fulfill all mission goals Initially in 2012 the mission was expected to be extended until 2016 20 but on July 14 2012 one of the four reaction wheels used for pointing the spacecraft stopped turning and completing the mission would only be possible if the other three all remained reliable 21 Then on May 11 2013 a second one failed disabling the collection of science data 22 and threatening the continuation of the mission 23 On August 15 2013 NASA announced that they had given up trying to fix the two failed reaction wheels This meant the current mission needed to be modified but it did not necessarily mean the end of planet hunting NASA had asked the space science community to propose alternative mission plans potentially including an exoplanet search using the remaining two good reaction wheels and thrusters 24 25 26 27 On November 18 2013 the K2 Second Light proposal was reported This would include utilizing the disabled Kepler in a way that could detect habitable planets around smaller dimmer red dwarfs 28 29 30 31 On May 16 2014 NASA announced the approval of the K2 extension 32 By January 2015 Kepler and its followup observations had found 1013 confirmed exoplanets in about 440 star systems along with a further 3199 unconfirmed planet candidates B 33 34 Four planets have been confirmed through Keplers K2 mission 35 In November 2013 astronomers estimated based on Kepler space mission data that there could be as many as 40 billion rocky Earthsize exoplanets orbiting in the habitable zones of Sunlike stars and red dwarfs within the Milky Way 36 37 38 It is estimated that 11 billion of these planets may be orbiting Sunlike stars 39 The nearest such planet may be 37 parsecs away according to the scientists 36 37 On January 6 2015 NASA announced the 1000th confirmed exoplanet discovered by the Kepler space telescope Four of the newly confirmed exoplanets were found to orbit within habitable zones of their related stars three of the four Kepler438b Kepler442b and Kepler452b are almost Earthsize and likely rocky the fourth Kepler440b is a superEarth 40 On May 10 2016 NASA verified 1284 new exoplanets found by Kepler the single largest finding of planets to date 41 42 43 Kepler data have also helped scientists observe and understand supernovae measurements were collected every halfhour so the light curves were especially useful for studying these types of astronomical events 44 On October 30 2018 after the spacecraft ran out of fuel NASA announced that the telescope would be retired 45 The telescope was shut down the same day bringing an end to its nineyear service Kepler observed 530506 stars and discovered 2662 exoplanets over its lifetime 15 A newer NASA mission TESS launched in 2018 is continuing the search for exoplanets 46 Spacecraft design edit Kepler in Astrotechs Hazardous Processing Facility Interactive 3D model of Kepler The telescope has a mass of 1039 kilograms and contains a Schmidt camera with a 095meter front corrector plate feeding a 14meter primary mirror at the time of its launch this was the largest mirror on any telescope outside Earth orbit 47 though the Herschel Space Observatory took this title a few months later Its telescope has a 115 deg 2 field of view roughly equivalent to the size of ones fist held at arms length Of this 105 deg 2 is of science quality with less than 11 vignetting The photometer has a soft focus to provide excellent photometry rather than sharp images The mission goal was a combined differential photometric precision of 20 ppm for a m 12 Sunlike star for a 65hour integration though the observations fell short of this objective Camera edit Keplers image sensor array The array is curved to account for Petzval field curvature The focal plane of the spacecrafts camera is made out of fortytwo 50 25 mm CCDs at 22001024 pixels each possessing a total resolution of 946 megapixels 48 49 which at the time made it the largest camera system launched into space 19 The array was cooled by heat pipes connected to an external radiator 1 The CCDs were read out every 65 seconds and coadded on board for 5889 seconds for short cadence targets and 17655 seconds for long cadence targets 50 Due to the larger bandwidth requirements for the former these were limited in number to 512 compared to 170000 for long cadence However even though at launch Kepler had the highest data rate of any NASA mission citation needed the 29minute sums of all 95 million pixels constituted more data than could be stored and sent back to Earth Therefore the science team preselected the relevant pixels associated with each star of interest amounting to about 6 percent of the pixels The data from these pixels was then requantized compressed and stored along with other auxiliary data in the onboard 16 gigabyte solidstate recorder Data that was stored and downlinked includes science stars pmode stars smear black level background and full fieldofview images 1 51 Primary mirror edit Comparison of primary mirror sizes for the Kepler telescope and other notable optical telescopes The Kepler primary mirror is 14 meters in diameter Manufactured by glass maker Corning using ultralow expansion glass the mirror is specifically designed to have a mass only 14 that of a solid mirror of the same size 52 53 To produce a space telescope system with sufficient sensitivity to detect relatively small planets as they pass in front of stars a very high reflectance coating on the primary mirror was required Using ion assisted evaporation Surface Optics Corp applied a protective ninelayer silver coating to enhance reflection and a dielectric interference coating to minimize the formation of color centers and atmospheric moisture absorption 54 55 Photometric performance edit In terms of photometric performance Kepler worked well much better than any Earthbound telescope but short of design goals The objective was a combined differential photometric precision of 20 parts per million on a magnitude 12 star for a 65hour integration This estimate was developed allowing 10 ppm for stellar variability roughly the value for the Sun The obtained accuracy for this observation has a wide range depending on the star and position on the focal plane with a median of 29 ppm Most of the additional noise appears to be due to a largerthanexpected variability in the stars themselves with the rest due to instrumental noise sources slightly larger than predicted 56 48 Because decrease in brightness from an Earthsize planet transiting a Sunlike star is so small only 80 ppm the increased noise means each individual transit is only a 27 event instead of the intended 4 This in turn means more transits must be observed to be sure of a detection Scientific estimates indicated that a mission lasting 7 to 8 years as opposed to the originally planned 35 years would be needed to find all transiting Earthsized planets 57 On April 4 2012 the Kepler mission was approved for extension through the fiscal year 2016 20 58 but this also depended on all remaining reaction wheels staying healthy which turned out not to be the case Orbit and orientation edit Keplers search volume in the context of the Milky Way The motion of Kepler relative to Earth slowly drifting away from Earth in a similar orbit looking like a spiral over time Kepler orbits the Sun 59 60 which avoids Earth occultations stray light and gravitational perturbations and torques inherent in an Earth orbit NASA has characterized Keplers orbit as Earthtrailing 61 With an orbital period of 3725 days Kepler is slowly falling farther behind Earth As of May 1 2018 update the distance to Kepler from Earth was about 0917 AU 3 This means that after about 26 years Kepler will reach the other side of the Sun and will get back to the neighborhood of the Earth after 51 years Until 2013 the photometer pointed to a field in the northern constellations of Cygnus Lyra and Draco which is well out of the ecliptic plane so that sunlight never enters the photometer as the spacecraft orbits 1 This is also the direction of the Solar Systems motion around the center of the galaxy Thus the stars which Kepler observed are roughly the same distance from the Galactic Center as the Solar System and also close to the galactic plane This fact is important if position in the galaxy is related to habitability as suggested by the Rare Earth hypothesis Orientation is threeaxis stabilized by sensing rotations using fineguidance sensors located on the instrument focal plane 1 and using reaction wheels and hydrazine thrusters 62 to control the orientation Animation of Kepler s trajectory Relative to the Sun Relative to Earth Relative to Sun and Earth Kepler Earth Sun Operations edit Keplers orbit The telescopes solar array was adjusted at solstices and equinoxes Kepler was operated out of Boulder Colorado by the Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics under contract to Ball Aerospace Technologies The spacecrafts solar array was rotated to face the Sun at the solstices and equinoxes so as to optimize the amount of sunlight falling on the solar array and to keep the heat radiator pointing towards deep space 1 Together LASP and Ball Aerospace controlled the spacecraft from a mission operations center located on the research campus of the University of Colorado LASP performs essential mission planning and the initial collection and distribution of the science data The missions initial lifecycle cost was estimated at US600 million including funding for 35 years of operation 1 In 2012 NASA announced that the Kepler mission would be funded until 2016 at a cost of about 20 million per year 20 Communications edit NASA contacted the spacecraft using the X band communication link twice a week for command and status updates Scientific data are downloaded once a month using the K a band link at a maximum data transfer rate of approximately 550 kBs The high gain antenna is not steerable so data collection is interrupted for a day to reorient the whole spacecraft and the high gain antenna for communications to Earth 1 16 The Kepler space telescope conducted its own partial analysis on board and only transmitted scientific data deemed necessary to the mission in order to conserve bandwidth 63 Data management edit Science data telemetry collected during mission operations at LASP is sent for processing to the Kepler Data Management Center which is located at the Space Telescope Science Institute on the campus of Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore Maryland The science data telemetry is decoded and processed into uncalibrated FITS format science data products by the DMC which are then passed along to the Science Operations Center at NASA Ames Research Center for calibration and final processing The SOC at NASA Ames Research Center develops and operates the tools needed to process scientific data for use by the Kepler Science Office Accordingly the SOC develops the pipeline data processing software based on scientific algorithms developed jointly by the SO and SOC During operations the SOC 64 Receives uncalibrated pixel data from the DMC Applies the analysis algorithms to produce calibrated pixels and light curves for each star Performs transit searches for detection of planets Performs data validation of candidate planets by evaluating various data products for consistency as a way to eliminate false positive detections The SOC also evaluates the photometric performance on an ongoing basis and provides the performance metrics to the SO and Mission Management Office Finally the SOC develops and maintains the projects scientific databases including catalogs and processed data The SOC finally returns calibrated data products and scientific results back to the DMC for longterm archiving and distribution to astronomers around the world through the Multimission Archive at STScI Reaction wheel failures edit On July 14 2012 one of the four reaction wheels used for fine pointing of the spacecraft failed 65 While Kepler requires only three reaction wheels to accurately aim the telescope another failure would leave the spacecraft unable to aim at its original field 66 After showing some problems in January 2013 a second reaction wheel failed on May 11 2013 ending Keplers primary mission The spacecraft was put into safe mode then from June to August 2013 a series of engineering tests were done to try to recover either failed wheel By August 15 2013 it was decided that the wheels were unrecoverable 24 25 26 and an engineering report was ordered to assess the spacecrafts remaining capabilities 24 This effort ultimately led to the K2 followon mission observing different fields near the ecliptic Operational timeline edit Keplers launch on March 7 2009 Interior illustration of Kepler A 2004 illustration of Kepler In January 2006 the projects launch was delayed eight months because of budget cuts and consolidation at NASA 17 It was delayed again by four months in March 2006 due to fiscal problems 17 At this time the highgain antenna was changed from a gimballed design to one fixed to the frame of the spacecraft to reduce cost and complexity at the cost of one observation day per month The Kepler observatory was launched on March 7 2009 at 034957 UTC aboard a Delta II rocket from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station Florida 2 5 The launch was a success and all three stages were completed by 0455 UTC The cover of the telescope was jettisoned on April 7 2009 and the first light images were taken on the next day 67 68 On April 20 2009 it was announced that the Kepler science team had concluded that further refinement of the focus would dramatically increase the scientific return 69 On April 23 2009 it was announced that the focus had been successfully optimized by moving the primary mirror 40 micrometers towards the focal plane and tilting the primary mirror 00072 degree 70 On May 13 2009 at 0001 UTC Kepler successfully completed its commissioning phase and began its search for planets around other stars 71 72 On June 19 2009 the spacecraft successfully sent its first science data to Earth It was discovered that Kepler had entered safe mode on June 15 A second safe mode event occurred on July 2 In both cases the event was triggered by a processor reset The spacecraft resumed normal operation on July 3 and the science data that had been collected since June 19 was downlinked that day 73 On October 14 2009 the cause of these safing events was determined to be a low voltage power supply that provides power to the RAD750 processor 74 On January 12 2010 one portion of the focal plane transmitted anomalous data suggesting a problem with focal plane MOD3 module covering two out of Keplers 42 CCDs As of October 2010 update the module was described as failed but the coverage still exceeded the science goals 75 Kepler downlinked roughly twelve gigabytes of data 76 about once per month 77 Field of view edit Diagram of Keplers investigated area with celestial coordinates Kepler has a fixed field of view against the sky The diagram to the right shows the celestial coordinates and where the detector fields are located along with the locations of a few bright stars with celestial north at the top left corner The mission website has a calculator 78 that will determine if a given object falls in the FOV and if so where it will appear in the photo detector output data stream Data on exoplanet candidates is submitted to the Kepler Followup Program or KFOP to conduct followup observations The photometers field of view in the constellations Cygnus Lyra and Draco Keplers field of view covers 115 square degrees around 025 percent of the sky or about two scoops of the Big Dipper Thus it would require around 400 Keplerlike telescopes to cover the whole sky 79 The Kepler field contains portions of the constellations Cygnus Lyra and Draco The nearest star system in Keplers field of view is the trinary star system Gliese 1245 15 light years from the Sun The brown dwarf WISE J20003629 228 1 light years from the Sun is also in the field of view but is invisible to Kepler due to emitting light primarily in infrared wavelengths Objectives and methods edit The scientific objective of the Kepler space telescope was to explore the structure and diversity of planetary systems 80 This spacecraft observes a large sample of stars to achieve several key goals To determine how many Earthsize and larger planets there are in or near the habitable zone 81 of a wide variety of spectral types of stars To determine the range of size and shape of the orbits of these planets To estimate how many planets there are in multiplestar systems To determine the range of orbit size brightness size mass and density of shortperiod giant planets To identify additional members of each discovered planetary system using other techniques Determine the properties of those stars that harbor planetary systems Most of the exoplanets previously detected by other projects were giant planets mostly the size of Jupiter and bigger Kepler was designed to look for planets 30 to 600 times less massive closer to the order of Earths mass The method used the transit method involves observing repeated transit of planets in front of their stars which causes a slight reduction in the stars apparent magnitude on the order of 001 for an Earthsize planet The degree of this reduction in brightness can be used to deduce the diameter of the planet and the interval between transits can be used to deduce the planets orbital period from which estimates of its orbital semimajor axis and its temperature can be calculated citation needed The probability of a random planetary orbit being along the lineofsight to a star is the diameter of the star divided by the diameter of the orbit 82 For an Earthsize planet at 1 AU transiting a Sunlike star the probability is 047 or about 1 in 210 82 For a planet like Venus orbiting a Sunlike star the probability is slightly higher at 065 82 If the host star has multiple planets the probability of additional detections is higher than the probability of initial detection assuming planets in a given system tend to orbit in similar planesan assumption consistent with current models of planetary system formation 82 For instance if a Kepler like mission conducted by aliens observed Earth transiting the Sun there is a 7 chance that it would also see Venus transiting 82 Keplers 115 deg 2 field of view gives it a much higher probability of detecting Earthsized planets than the Hubble Space Telescope which has a field of view of only 10 sq arcminutes Moreover Kepler is dedicated to detecting planetary transits while the Hubble Space Telescope is used to address a wide range of scientific questions and rarely looks continuously at just one starfield Of the approximately halfmillion stars in Keplers field of view around 150000 stars were selected for observation More than 90000 are Gtype stars on or near the main sequence Thus Kepler was designed to be sensitive to wavelengths of 400865 nm where brightness of those stars peaks Most of the stars observed by Kepler have apparent visual magnitude between 14 and 16 but the brightest observed stars have apparent visual magnitude of 8 or lower Most of the planet candidates were initially not expected to be confirmed due to being too faint for followup observations 83 All the selected stars are observed simultaneously with the spacecraft measuring variations in their brightness every thirty minutes This provides a better chance for seeing a transit The mission was designed to maximize the probability of detecting planets orbiting other stars 1 84 Because Kepler must observe at least three transits to confirm that the dimming of a star was caused by a transiting planet and because larger planets give a signal that is easier to check scientists expected the first reported results to be larger Jupitersize planets in tight orbits The first of these were reported after only a few months of operation Smaller planets and planets farther from their sun would take longer and discovering planets comparable to Earth were expected to take three years or longer 59 Data collected by Kepler is also being used for studying variable stars of various types and performing asteroseismology 85 particularly on stars showing solarlike oscillations 86 Planet finding process edit Finding planet candidates edit Artists impression of Kepler Once Kepler has collected and sent back the data raw light curves are constructed Brightness values are then adjusted to take the brightness variations due to the rotation of the spacecraft into account The next step is processing light curves into a more easily observable form and letting software select signals that seem potentially transitlike At this point any signal that shows potential transitlike features is called a threshold crossing event These signals are individually inspected in two inspection rounds with the first round taking only a few seconds per target This inspection eliminates erroneously selected nonsignals signals caused by instrumental noise and obvious eclipsing binaries 87 Threshold crossing events that pass these tests are called Kepler Objects of Interest receive a KOI designation and are archived KOIs are inspected more thoroughly in a process called dispositioning Those which pass the dispositioning are called Kepler planet candidates The KOI archive is not static meaning that a Kepler candidate could end up in the falsepositive list upon further inspection In turn KOIs that were mistakenly classified as false positives could end up back in the candidates list 88 Not all the planet candidates go through this process Circumbinary planets do not show strictly periodic transits and have to be inspected through other methods In addition thirdparty researchers use different dataprocessing methods or even search planet candidates from the unprocessed light curve data As a consequence those planets may be missing KOI designation Confirming planet candidates edit Kepler mission new exoplanet candidates as of June 19 2017 89 Once suitable candidates have been found from Kepler data it is necessary to rule out false positives with followup tests Usually Kepler candidates are imaged individually with moreadvanced groundbased telescopes in order to resolve any background objects which could contaminate the brightness signature of the transit signal 90 Another method to rule out planet candidates is astrometry for which Kepler can collect good data even though doing so was not a design goal While Kepler cannot detect planetarymass objects with this method it can be used to determine if the transit was caused by a stellarmass object 91 Through other detection methods edit There are a few different exoplanet detection methods which help to rule out false positives by giving further proof that a candidate is a real planet One of the methods called doppler spectroscopy requires followup observations from groundbased telescopes This method works well if the planet is massive or is located around a relatively bright star While current spectrographs are insufficient for confirming planetary candidates with small masses around relatively dim stars this method can be used to discover additional massive nontransiting planet candidates around targeted stars citation needed A photo taken by Kepler with two points of interest outlined Celestial north is towards the lower left corner In multiplanetary systems planets can often be confirmed through transit timing variation by looking at the time between successive transits which may vary if planets are gravitationally perturbed by each other This helps to confirm relatively lowmass planets even when the star is relatively distant Transit timing variations indicate that two or more planets belong to the same planetary system There are even cases where a nontransiting planet is also discovered in this way 92 Circumbinary planets show much larger transit timing variations between transits than planets gravitationally disturbed by other planets Their transit duration times also vary significantly Transit timing and duration variations for circumbinary planets are caused by the orbital motion of the host stars rather than by other planets 93 In addition if the planet is massive enough it can cause slight variations of the host stars orbital periods Despite being harder to find circumbinary planets due to their nonperiodic transits it is much easier to confirm them as timing patterns of transits cannot be mimicked by an eclipsing binary or a background star system 94 In addition to transits planets orbiting around their stars undergo reflectedlight variationslike the Moon they go through phases from full to new and back again Because Kepler cannot resolve the planet from the star it sees only the combined light and the brightness of the host star seems to change over each orbit in a periodic manner Although the effect is smallthe photometric precision required to see a closein giant planet is about the same as to detect an Earthsized planet in transit across a solartype starJupitersized planets with an orbital period of a few days or less are detectable by sensitive space telescopes such as Kepler In the long run this method may help find more planets than the transit method because the reflected light variation with orbital phase is largely independent of the planets orbital inclination and does not require the planet to pass in front of the disk of the star In addition the phase function of a giant planet is also a function of its thermal properties and atmosphere if any Therefore the phase curve may constrain other planetary properties such as the particle size distribution of the atmospheric particles 95 Keplers photometric precision is often high enough to observe a stars brightness changes caused by doppler beaming or a stars shape deformation by a companion These can sometimes be used to rule out hot Jupiter candidates as false positives caused by a star or a brown dwarf when these effects are too noticeable 96 However there are some cases where such effects are detected even by planetarymass companions such as TrES2b 97 Through validation edit If a planet cannot be detected through at least one of the other detection methods it can be confirmed by determining if the possibility of a Kepler candidate being a real planet is significantly larger than any falsepositive scenarios combined One of the first methods was to see if other telescopes can see the transit as well The first planet confirmed through this method was Kepler22b which was also observed with the Spitzer Space Telescope in addition to analyzing any other falsepositive possibilities 98 Such confirmation is costly as small planets can generally be detected only with space telescopes In 2014 a new confirmation method called validation by multiplicity was announced From the planets previously confirmed through various methods it was found that planets in most planetary systems orbit in a relatively flat plane similar to the planets found in the Solar System This means that if a star has multiple planet candidates it is very likely a real planetary system 99 Transit signals still need to meet several criteria which rule out falsepositive scenarios For instance it has to have considerable signaltonoise ratio it has at least three observed transits orbital stability of those systems have to be stable and transit curve has to have a shape that partly eclipsing binaries could not mimic the transit signal In addition its orbital period needs to be 16 days or longer to rule out common false positives caused by eclipsing binaries 100 Validation by multiplicity method is very efficient and allows to confirm hundreds of Kepler candidates in a relatively short amount of time A new validation method using a tool called PASTIS has been developed It makes it possible to confirm a planet even when only a single candidate transit event for the host star has been detected A drawback of this tool is that it requires a relatively high signaltonoise ratio from Kepler data so it can mainly confirm only larger planets or planets around quiet and relatively bright stars Currently the analysis of Kepler candidates through this method is underway 101 PASTIS was first successful for validating the planet Kepler420b 102 K2 Extension edit Predicted structure of the Milky Way overlaid with the original Kepler search space 6 In April 2012 an independent panel of senior NASA scientists recommended that the Kepler mission be continued through 2016 According to the senior review Kepler observations needed to continue until at least 2015 to achieve all the stated scientific goals 103 On November 14 2012 NASA announced the completion of Keplers primary mission and the beginning of its extended mission which ended in 2018 when it ran out of fuel 104 Reaction wheel issues edit In July 2012 one of Keplers four reaction wheels failed 24 On May 11 2013 a second wheel failed jeopardizing the continuation of the mission as three wheels are necessary for its planet hunting 22 23 Kepler had not collected science data since May because it was not able to point with sufficient accuracy 105 On July 18 and 22 reaction wheels 4 and 2 were tested respectively wheel 4 only rotated counterclockwise but wheel 2 ran in both directions albeit with significantly elevated friction levels 106 A further test of wheel 4 on July 25 managed to achieve bidirectional rotation 107 Both wheels however exhibited too much friction to be useful 26 On August 2 NASA put out a call for proposals to use the remaining capabilities of Kepler for other scientific missions Starting on August 8 a full systems evaluation was conducted It was determined that wheel 2 could not provide sufficient precision for scientific missions and the spacecraft was returned to a rest state to conserve fuel 24 Wheel 4 was previously ruled out because it exhibited higher friction levels than wheel 2 in previous tests 107 Sending astronauts to fix Kepler is not an option because it orbits the Sun and is millions of kilometers from Earth 26 On August 15 2013 NASA announced that Kepler would not continue searching for planets using the transit method after attempts to resolve issues with two of the four reaction wheels failed 24 25 26 An engineering report was ordered to assess the spacecrafts capabilities its two good reaction wheels and its thrusters 24 Concurrently a scientific study was conducted to determine whether enough knowledge can be obtained from Keplers limited scope to justify its 18 million per year cost Possible ideas included searching for asteroids and comets looking for evidence of supernovas and finding huge exoplanets through gravitational microlensing 26 Another proposal was to modify the software on Kepler to compensate for the disabled reaction wheels Instead of the stars being fixed and stable in Keplers field of view they will drift Proposed software was to track this drift and more or less completely recover the mission goals despite being unable to hold the stars in a fixed view 108 Previously collected data continued to be analyzed 109 Second Light edit In November 2013 a new mission plan named K2 Second Light was presented for consideration 29 30 31 110 K2 would involve using Keplers remaining capability photometric precision of about 300 parts per million compared with about 20 parts per million earlier to collect data for the study of supernova explosions star formation and SolarSystem bodies such as asteroids and comets and for finding and studying more exoplanets 29 30 110 In this proposed mission plan Kepler would search a much larger area in the plane of Earths orbit around the Sun 29 30 110 Celestial objects including exoplanets stars and others detected by the K2 mission would be associated with the EPIC acronym standing for Ecliptic Plane Input Catalog K2 mission timeline 111 In early 2014 the spacecraft underwent successful testing for the K2 mission 112 From March to May 2014 data from a new field called Field 0 was collected as a testing run 113 On May 16 2014 NASA announced the approval of extending the Kepler mission to the K2 mission 32 Keplers photometric precision for the K2 mission was estimated to be 50 ppm on a magnitude 12 star for a 65hour integration 114 In February 2014 photometric precision for the K2 mission using twowheel finepoint precision operations was measured as 44 ppm on magnitude 12 stars for a 65hour integration The analysis of these measurements by NASA suggests the K2 photometric precision approaches that of the Kepler archive of threewheel finepoint precision data 115 On May 29 2014 campaign fields 0 to 13 were reported and described in detail 116 K2 proposal explained 30 Field 1 of the K2 mission is set towards the Leo Virgo region of the sky while Field 2 is towards the head area of Scorpius and includes two globular clusters Messier 4 and Messier 80 117 and part of the ScorpiusCentaurus association which is only about 11 million years old 118 and 120140 parsecs distant 119 with probably over 1000 members 120 On December 18 2014 NASA announced that the K2 mission had detected its first confirmed exoplanet a superEarth named HIP 116454 b Its signature was found in a set of engineering data meant to prepare the spacecraft for the full K2 mission Radial velocity followup observations were needed as only a single transit of the planet was detected 121 During a scheduled contact on April 7 2016 Kepler was found to be operating in emergency mode the lowest operational and most fuel intensive mode Mission operations declared a spacecraft emergency which afforded them priority access to NASAs Deep Space Network 122 123 By the evening of April 8 the spacecraft had been upgraded to safe mode and on April 10 it was placed into pointrest state 124 a stable mode which provides normal communication and the lowest fuel burn 122 At that time the cause of the emergency was unknown but it was not believed that Keplers reaction wheels or a planned maneuver to support K2 s Campaign 9 were responsible Operators downloaded and analyzed engineering data from the spacecraft with the prioritization of returning to normal science operations 122 125 Kepler was returned to science mode on April 22 126 The emergency caused the first half of Campaign 9 to be shortened by two weeks 127 In June 2016 NASA announced a K2 mission extension of three additional years beyond the expected exhaustion of onboard fuel in 2018 128 In August 2018 NASA roused the spacecraft from sleep mode applied a modified configuration to deal with thruster problems that degraded pointing performance and began collecting scientific data for the 19th observation campaign finding that the onboard fuel was not yet utterly exhausted 129 On October 30 2018 NASA announced that the spacecraft was out of fuel and its mission was officially ended 130 Mission results edit Detail of Kepler s image of the investigated area showing open star cluster NGC 6791 Celestial north is towards the lower left corner Detail of Kepler s image of the investigated area The location of TrES2b within this image is shown Celestial north is towards the lower left corner The Kepler space telescope was in active operation from 2009 through 2013 with the first main results announced on January 4 2010 As expected the initial discoveries were all shortperiod planets As the mission continued additional longerperiod candidates were found As of November 2018 update Kepler has discovered 5011 exoplanet candidates and 2662 confirmed exoplanets 131 132 As of August 2022 2056 exoplanet candidates remain to be confirmed and 2711 are now confirmed exoplanets 133 2009 edit NASA held a press conference to discuss early science results of the Kepler mission on August 6 2009 134 At this press conference it was revealed that Kepler had confirmed the existence of the previously known transiting exoplanet HATP7b and was functioning well enough to discover Earthsize planets 135 136 Because Keplers detection of planets depends on seeing very small changes in brightness stars that vary in brightness by themselves are not useful in this search 77 From the first few months of data Kepler scientists determined that about 7500 stars from the initial target list are such variable stars These were dropped from the target list and replaced by new candidates On November 4 2009 the Kepler project publicly released the light curves of the dropped stars 137 The first new planet candidate observed by Kepler was originally marked as a false positive because of uncertainties in the mass of its parent star However it was confirmed ten years later and is now designated Kepler1658b 138 139 The first six weeks of data revealed five previously unknown planets all very close to their stars 140 141 Among the notable results are one of the least dense planets yet found 142 two lowmass white dwarfs 143 that were initially reported as being members of a new class of stellar objects 144 and Kepler16b a wellcharacterized planet orbiting a binary star 2010 edit On June 15 2010 the Kepler mission released data on all but 400 of the 156000 planetary target stars to the public 706 targets from this first data set have viable exoplanet candidates with sizes ranging from as small as Earth to larger than Jupiter The identity and characteristics of 306 of the 706 targets were given The released targets included five citation needed candidate multiplanet systems including six extra exoplanet candidates 145 Only 335 days of data were available for most of the candidates 145 NASA also announced data for another 400 candidates were being withheld to allow members of the Kepler team to perform followup observations 146 The data for these candidates was published February 2 2011 147 The Kepler results based on the candidates in the list released in 2010 implied that most candidate planets have radii less than half that of Jupiter The results also imply that small candidate planets with periods less than thirty days are much more common than large candidate planets with periods less than thirty days and that the groundbased discoveries are sampling the largesize tail of the size distribution 145 This contradicted older theories which had suggested small and Earthsize planets would be relatively infrequent 148 149 Based on extrapolations from the Kepler data an estimate of around 100 million habitable planets in the Milky Way may be realistic 150 Some media reports of the TED talk have led to the misunderstanding that Kepler had actually found these planets This was clarified in a letter to the Director of the NASA Ames Research Center for the Kepler Science Council dated August 2 2010 states Analysis of the current Kepler data does not support the assertion that Kepler has found any Earthlike planets 7 151 152 In 2010 Kepler identified two systems containing objects which are smaller and hotter than their parent stars KOI 74 and KOI 81 153 These objects are probably lowmass white dwarfs produced by previous episodes of mass transfer in their systems 143 2011 edit A size comparison of the exoplanets Kepler20e 154 and Kepler20f 155 with Venus and Earth On February 2 2011 the Kepler team announced the results of analysis of the data taken between 2 May and September 16 2009 147 They found 1235 planetary candidates circling 997 host stars 156 68 planets were approximately Earthsize 288 superEarth size 662 Neptunesize 165 Jupitersize and 19 up to twice the size of Jupiter In contrast to previous work roughly 74 of the planets are smaller than Neptune most likely as a result of previous work finding large planets more easily than smaller ones That February 2 2011 release of 1235 exoplanet candidates included 54 that may be in the habitable zone including five less than twice the size of Earth 157 158 There were previously only two planets thought to be in the habitable zone so these new findings represent an enormous expansion of the potential number of Goldilocks planets 159 All of the habitable zone candidates found thus far orbit stars significantly smaller and cooler than the Sun 160 Of all the new planet candidates 68 are 125 of Earth s size or smaller or smaller than all previously discovered exoplanets 158 Earthsize and superEarthsize is defined as less than or equal to 2 Earth radii Table 5 147 Six such planet candidates namely KOI 32601 KOI 70103 KOI 26801 KOI 102601 KOI 85401 KOI 7003 Table 6 147 are in the habitable zone 157 A more recent study found that one of these candidates is in fact much larger and hotter than first reported 161 The frequency of planet observations was highest for exoplanets two to three times Earthsize and then declined in inverse proportionality to the area of the planet The best estimate after accounting for observational biases was 54 of stars host Earthsize candidates 68 host superEarthsize candidates 193 host Neptunesize candidates and 255 host Jupitersize or larger candidates Multiplanet systems are common 17 of the host stars have multicandidate systems and 339 of all the planets are in multiple planet systems 162 By December 5 2011 the Kepler team announced that they had discovered 2326 planetary candidates of which 207 are similar in size to Earth 680 are superEarthsize 1181 are Neptunesize 203 are Jupitersize and 55 are larger than Jupiter Compared to the February 2011 figures the number of Earthsize and superEarthsize planets increased by 200 and 140 respectively Moreover 48 planet candidates were found in the habitable zones of surveyed stars marking a decrease from the February figure this was due to the more stringent criteria in use in the December data 163 On December 20 2011 the Kepler team announced the discovery of the first Earthsize exoplanets Kepler20e 154 and Kepler20f 155 orbiting a Sunlike star Kepler20 164 Based on Keplers findings astronomer Seth Shostak estimated in 2011 that within a thousand lightyears of Earth there are at least 30000 habitable planets 165 Also based on the findings the Kepler team has estimated that there are at least 50 billion planets in the Milky Way of which at least 500 million are in the habitable zone 166 In March 2011 astronomers at NASAs Jet Propulsion Laboratory reported that about 14 to 27 percent of all Sunlike stars are expected to have Earthsize planets within the habitable zones of their stars This means there are two billion of these Earth analogs in the Milky Way alone The JPL astronomers also noted that there are 50 billion other galaxies potentially yielding more than one sextillion Earth analog planets if all galaxies have similar numbers of planets to the Milky Way 167 2012 edit In January 2012 an international team of astronomers reported that each star in the Milky Way may host on averageat least 16 planets suggesting that over 160 billion starbound planets may exist in the Milky Way 168 169 Kepler also recorded distant stellar superflares some of which are 10000 times more powerful than the 1859 Carrington event 170 The superflares may be triggered by closeorbiting Jupiter sized planets 170 The Transit Timing Variation technique which was used to discover Kepler9d gained popularity for confirming exoplanet discoveries 171 A planet in a system with four stars was also confirmed the first time such a system had been discovered 172 As of 2012 update there were a total of 2321 candidates 163 173 174 Of these 207 are similar in size to Earth 680 are superEarthsize 1181 are Neptunesize 203 are Jupitersize and 55 are larger than Jupiter Moreover 48 planet candidates were found in the habitable zones of surveyed stars The Kepler team estimated that 54 of all stars host Earthsize planet candidates and that 17 of all stars have multiple planets 2013 edit A chart showing Kepler discoveries in context of all discovered exoplanets with some transit probabilities indicated for example scenarios According to a study by Caltech astronomers published in January 2013 the Milky Way contains at least as many planets as it does stars resulting in 100400 billion exoplanets 175 176 The study based on planets orbiting the star Kepler32 suggests that planetary systems may be common around stars in the Milky Way The discovery of 461 more candidates was announced on January 7 2013 105 The longer Kepler watches the more planets with long periods it can detect 105 Since the last Kepler catalog was released in February 2012 the number of candidates discovered in the Kepler data has increased by 20 percent and now totals 2740 potential planets orbiting 2036 stars A candidate newly announced on January 7 2013 was Kepler69c an Earthsize exoplanet orbiting a star similar to the Sun in the habitable zone and possibly habitable 177 In April 2013 a white dwarf was discovered bending the light of its companion red dwarf in the KOI256 star system 178 In April 2013 NASA announced the discovery of three new Earthsize exoplanets Kepler62e Kepler62f and Kepler69c in the habitable zones of their respective host stars Kepler62 and Kepler69 The new exoplanets are considered prime candidates for possessing liquid water and thus a habitable environment 179 180 181 A more recent analysis has shown that Kepler69c is likely more analogous to Venus and thus unlikely to be habitable 182 On May 15 2013 NASA announced the space telescope had been crippled by failure of a reaction wheel that keeps it pointed in the right direction A second wheel had previously failed and the telescope required three wheels to be operational for the instrument to function properly Further testing in July and August determined that while Kepler was capable of using its damaged reaction wheels to prevent itself from entering safe mode and of downlinking previously collected science data it was not capable of collecting further science data as previously configured 183 Scientists working on the Kepler project said there was a backlog of data still to be looked at and that more discoveries would be made in the following couple of years despite the setback 184 Although no new science data from Kepler field had been collected since the problem an additional sixtythree candidates were announced in July 2013 based on the previously collected observations 185 In November 2013 the second Kepler science conference was held The discoveries included the median size of planet candidates getting smaller compared to early 2013 preliminary results of the discovery of a few circumbinary planets and planets in the habitable zone 186 2014 edit Histogram of exoplanet discoveries The yellow shaded bar shows newly announced planets including those verified by the multiplicity technique On February 13 over 530 additional planet candidates were announced residing around single planet systems Several of them were nearly Earthsized and located in the habitable zone This number was further increased by about 400 in June 2014 187 On February 26 scientists announced that data from Kepler had confirmed the existence of 715 new exoplanets A new statistical method of confirmation was used called verification by multiplicity which is based on how many planets around multiple stars were found to be real planets This allowed much quicker confirmation of numerous candidates which are part of multiplanetary systems 95 of the discovered exoplanets were smaller than Neptune and four including Kepler296f were less than 2 12 the size of Earth and were in habitable zones where surface temperatures are suitable for liquid water 99 188 189 190 In March a study found that small planets with orbital periods of less than one day are usually accompanied by at least one additional planet with orbital period of 150 days This study also noted that ultrashort period planets are almost always smaller than 2 Earth radii unless it is a misaligned hot Jupiter 191 On April 17 the Kepler team announced the discovery of Kepler186f the first nearly Earthsized planet located in the habitable zone This planet orbits around a red dwarf 192 In May 2014 K2 observations fields 0 to 13 were announced and described in detail 116 K2 observations began in June 2014 In July 2014 the first discoveries from K2 field data were reported in the form of eclipsing binaries Discoveries were derived from a Kepler engineering data set which was collected prior to campaign 0 193 in preparation to the main K2 mission 194 On September 23 2014 NASA reported that the K2 mission had completed campaign 1 195 the first official set of science observations and that campaign 2 196 was underway 197 Kepler observed KSN 2011b a Type Ia supernova in the process of exploding before during and after 198 Campaign 3 199 lasted from November 14 2014 to February 6 2015 and included 16375 standard long cadence and 55 standard short cadence targets 116 2015 edit This section is in list format but may read better as prose You can help by converting this section if appropriate Editing help is available In January 2015 the number of confirmed Kepler planets exceeded 1000 At least two of the discovered planets announced that month were likely rocky and in the habitable zone 40 Also in January 2015 NASA reported that five confirmed subearthsized rocky exoplanets all smaller than the planet Venus were found orbiting the 112 billion year old star Kepler444 making this star system at 80 of the age of the universe the oldest yet discovered 200 201 202 In April 2015 campaign 4 203 was reported to last between February 7 2015 and April 24 2015 and to include observations of nearly 16000 target stars and two notable open star clusters Pleiades and Hyades 204 In May 2015 Kepler observed a newly discovered supernova KSN 2011b before during and after explosion Details of the prenova moments may help scientists better understand dark energy 198 On July 24 2015 NASA announced the discovery of Kepler452b a confirmed exoplanet that is nearEarth in size and found orbiting the habitable zone of a Sunlike star 205 206 The seventh Kepler planet candidate catalog was released containing 4696 candidates and increase of 521 candidates since the previous catalog release in January 2015 207 208 On September 14 2015 astronomers reported unusual light fluctuations of KIC 8462852 an Ftype mainsequence star in the constellation Cygnus as detected by Kepler while searching for exoplanets Various hypotheses have been presented including comets asteroids and an alien civilization 209 210 211 2016 edit By May 10 2016 the Kepler mission had verified 1284 new planets 41 Based on their size about 550 could be rocky planets Nine of these orbit in their stars habitable zone Kepler560b Kepler705b Kepler1229b Kepler1410b Kepler1455b Kepler1544 b Kepler1593b Kepler1606b and Kepler1638b 41 Data releases edit The Kepler team originally promised to release data within one year of observations 212 However this plan was changed after launch with data being scheduled for release up to three years after its collection 213 This resulted in considerable criticism 214 215 216 217 218 leading the Kepler science team to release the third quarter of their data one year and nine months after collection 219 The data through September 2010 was made public in January 2012 220 Followups by others edit Periodically the Kepler team releases a list of candidates to the public Using this information a team of astronomers collected radial velocity data using the SOPHIE chelle spectrograph to confirm the existence of the candidate KOI428b in 2010 later named Kepler40b 221 In 2011 the same team confirmed candidate KOI423b later named Kepler39b 222 Citizen scientist participation edit Since December 2010 Kepler mission data has been used for the Planet Hunters project which allows volunteers to look for transit events in the light curves of Kepler images to identify planets that computer algorithms might miss 223 By June 2011 users had found sixtynine potential candidates that were previously unrecognized by the Kepler mission team 224 The team has plans to publicly credit amateurs who spot such planets In January 2012 the BBC program Stargazing Live aired a public appeal for volunteers to analyse Planethuntersorg data for potential new exoplanets This led two amateur astronomersone in Peterborough Englandto discover a new Neptune sized exoplanet to be named Threapleton Holmes B 225 One hundred thousand other volunteers were also engaged in the search by late January analyzing over one million Kepler images by early 2012 226 One such exoplanet PH1b was discovered in 2012 A second exoplanet PH2b was discovered in 2013 In April 2017 ABC Stargazing Live a variation of BBC Stargazing Live launched the Zooniverse project Exoplanet Explorers While Planethuntersorg worked with archived data Exoplanet Explorers used recently downlinked data from the K2 mission On the first day of the project 184 transit candidates were identified that passed simple tests On the second day the research team identified a star system later named K2138 with a Sunlike star and four superEarths in a tight orbit In the end volunteers helped to identify 90 exoplanet candidates 227 228 The citizen scientists that helped discover the new star system will be added as coauthors in the research paper when published 229 Confirmed exoplanets edit Main article

Kepler45b 233 as well as the planets orbiting Kepler223 234 and Kepler42 235 The KOI acronym indicates that the star is a K epler O bject of I nterest Kepler Input Catalog edit Main article Kepler Input Catalog The Kepler Input Catalog is a publicly searchable database of roughly 132 million targets used for the Kepler Spectral Classification Program and the Kepler mission 236 237 The catalog alone is not used for finding Kepler targets because only a portion of the listed stars can be observed by the spacecraft 236 Solar System observations edit Kepler has been assigned an observatory code in order to report its astrometric observations of small Solar System bodies to the Minor Planet Center In 2013 the alternative NEOKepler mission was proposed a search for nearEarth objects in particular potentially hazardous asteroids Its unique orbit and larger field of view than existing survey telescopes allow it to look for objects inside Earths orbit It was predicted a 12month survey could make a significant contribution to the hunt for PHAs as well as potentially locating targets for NASAs Asteroid Redirect Mission 238 Keplers first discovery in the Solar System however was 2016 BP 81 a 200kilometer cold classical Kuiper belt object located beyond the orbit of Neptune 239 Retirement edit Artwork commissioned by NASA to commemorate the retirement of Kepler in OctoberNovember 2018 9 10 On October 30 2018 NASA announced that the Kepler space telescope having run out of fuel and after nine years of service and the discovery of over 2600 exoplanets has been officially retired and will maintain its current safe orbit away from Earth 9 10 The spacecraft was deactivated with a goodnight command sent from the missions control center at the Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics on November 15 2018 240 Keplers retirement coincides with the 388th anniversary of Johannes Kepler s death in 1630 241 See also edit Kepler22b the first exoplanet confirmed by Kepler to have
